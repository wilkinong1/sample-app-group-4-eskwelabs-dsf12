I personally feel like I’m starting to look it faster and faster these days. I was looking for a product to help smooth fine lines and wrinkles, and of course slow the clock down as much as possible. Due to the rave reviews I have read about Sunday Riley, especially the Luna, I was excited to try all of her products. Around Christmas I purchased 2 of the “go to bed with me“ sets. I felt like this was a good cost effective measure to get a real test run on the whole system (cleanser, essence, A+, 5 star, Luna, Good Genes and Ice). $200 later and a few months, I’m here to report that I’m not impressed. I’m not sure what the hype is about. I didn’t see any improvement from the A+, 5 star, Luna, Ice, or Good Genes. Maybe it is just not right for my skin but I honestly think whether it was “right“ for me or not, there should have been some effect or minor improvement. My only other complaint is about the Luna, it doesn’t soak in, you go to bed slimy. On the other hand, the two products I didn’t expect to really care about but ended up really liking are the essence (Pink Drink) and the cleanser (Ceramic Slip).

I am a sucker for a good packaging. The glass jar itself feels very high end, and it’s a fitting container for such an amazing cream! It looks a bit thick at first glance, but as soon as you spread it around on your face, it feels really lightweight and my skin just immediately looks dewy and hydrated. I have stubborn little fine lines on my forehead, and whenever I put on foundation it looked very dry and the lines looked very exaggerated, But with this cream I can see how every subsequent product I put on (sunscreen, primer, foundation and powder) all seem to blend seemlessly, and my face just looks healthy! I may consider purchasing the refills in the future. It’s one of the other things I love about this product - you can buy refills and just use the amazing jar as long as you can.The cream isn’t overwhelming fragranced, but does lightly smell like rose.

This is my first time trying this brand and now I can see what all the hype is about. The Magic Cream Moisturizer is so unique and amazing. First, the packaging is luxurious and beautiful. The cream has a very light rose scent. The texture is unique and is on the thicker side. Since it is thicker, only a little amount is needed to do the trick. I see this jar lasting awhile. It applies smooth and melts right into skin.  It doesn’t feel one bit heavy or oily.  I have combination skin and I really love how the cream makes my skin feel. My skin looks so radiant and hydrated right upon application. It really gives a youthful glow. It wears so well under makeup and it doubles as a primer.  Lastly, it leaves my skin feeling baby smooth. This cream claims to reduce the look of wrinkles and firm the skin in 8 weeks. I will keep you posted on the progress. The key ingredients are hyaluronic acids, vitamin C + E, and bionymph peptide complex. Overall, I’m surprised how much I love this cream.  My favorite thing about the magic cream is the radiance it gives my skin, how smooth it makes my skin, and that it doubles as a makeup primer!

199091,5,2023-03-09,"I received this item from Influenster and Charlotte Tilbury, in exchange for my honest (very honest) review. Full disclosure, I am mostly a La Mer girlie who enjoys a lot of moisturizing power in my creams. I have a lot of dryness especially around my eyes that I treat with good moisturizers that pack a punch in terms of hydration.I got a sample of the CT eye cream once and loved it enough to buy the full size. I’ve tried the CT magic night cream and the regular CT magic cream and both are good but not miraculous, in my opinion. But as the CT eye cream has become a staple for me, I was curious to see what this CT magic cream with hyaluronic acid felt like. When I first placed it on my skin, it felt luxurious. Definitely creamy. The consistency is almost as thick as La Mer. It also has a heavenly smell. The payoff in terms of hydration for the next day was great. I used the cream for 4 days straight and was super impressed by the way my skin felt. I think it does work on reducing wrinkles because my face looked really good and smooth! I was really in shock by the result after so few days. As far as working as a primer, I’m sure it’d be amazing. But I like it more for just sitting on the face alone to moisturize overnight. To me, in order to add a cream to my routine, it has to (1) serve a function like anti-aging or  moisturize and make my skin hydrated (2) smell good and (3) have resourceful packaging. This cream ticks all those boxes. At the price point, it is extremely valuable. This cream could easily go for $98 and still be worth it.

199179,3,2023-03-01,"This is a perfectly fine product if you like a luxury face cream. There are no special ingredients. The packaging is weighty, but of course the cap will show fingerprints. It is medium-heavily scented - rose with a kind of lemongrass/citronella undertone - but it dissipates quickly. The texture is thick but there are definitely emollients that make it apply with a more silky feel. There was nothing I disliked about the product. I tested this side-by-side (split face/neck) with my old reliable, Vanicream, and the results over ~4 weeks were exactly the same. No additional moisture, glow, or other factors.

199186,5,2023-03-01,"I absolutely adore Charlotte Tilbury lipsticks and foundation, but never tried her skincare line until now. Charlotte’s Magic Cream really lives up to its name. Everything from the box to the glass jar feels luxurious. I loved the fact that there was so much information on the very stylish box, and even the little heart in the corner made it feel so special. I am a sucker for a good packaging. The glass jar itself feels so nice, and it’s a fitting vessel for such an amazing cream! The cream doesn’t have any overwhelming scent, it just smells really clean, if that makes sense. I think because of it’s ingredients and the lack of any fragrance makes it really suitable for any skin type, even sensitive ones. It looks a bit thick at first glance, but as soon as you spread it around onnyour face, it feels really lightweight and my skin just immediately looks glowier. I have stubborn little fine lines on my forehead, and whenever I put on foundation it looked very dry and the lines looked very exaggerated. But with this amazing cream I can see how every subsequent product I put on (sunscreen, primer, foundation and powder) all seem to blend seemlessly, and my face just looks healthy and glowy.

I emailed tatcha and was told it might not work for every skin type but it was dermatologist tested so I thought maybe my skin was just too sensitive for it. I gave the rest of the product to my friend since I could no longer use it, and shortly after he developed periocular dermatitis. It was so strange that the same condition happened to both of us within months and the only connection we can make is this moisturizer. It’s also strange because this condition happens mostly in women and he is a man. We had to get on antibiotics and use a prescription cream and it was such a pain to get rid of.

Do not buy the gel version it is not moisturizing enough and I had to return it. It may make your skin a touch red so sunscreen is a must as with any vitamin C product but I realize there is nothing like this for making my skin look WAY younger. Wrinkles pretty much disappear almost on the first use. The nice thing is you can try it in the store and not have to order it to know if it works for you. I got a small sample of it and when I put it on my husband said “wow what did you do?“ I’m not making any of this up. It sounds like a too good to be true review but I have literally wasted thousands on creams. I don’t want to mention that it made me slightly red because then you might keep looking but honestly the touch of red is sooooo worth it to be 10 years younger. People need to try this. I hope this helps you. I wasted so much money at creams at sephora before finding this, drunk elephant no, squalane oil themed creams no, clinique redness no, clarins oil no, josie maran whipped pretty excellent but not as good as this, origins planscriptions is garbage, anyway too many to list but you get the idea.

I have to double cleanse when I use this- meaning I use this to remove makeup and then then go in with a different cleanser to clean my skin. I don’t mind double cleansing as it’s the best way to get your skin completely clean regardless of if you’re using this product or not, but some people won’t like the extra step. As far as other balms I’ve used, this is one of the best. It gets oily, but not run all over your hand oily and it does an INCREDIBLE job at breaking down makeup, including waterproof mascara. However I gave this 4 stars as the packaging could be improved. I liked the idea of a squeeze tube because it is more hygienic than dipping your hand a jar and risking contamination. This balm however is too thick for a squeeze tube and it was extremely hard to get out. I worry that as I get lower on product in the squeeze tube it will be nearly impossible to get any out. The price is very reasonable though! You get a lot of product for a small price and a little goes a long way. This tube will likely last me months and I use this everyday.

I was in Sephora a few weeks ago and I was so excited to learn about Inkey List because I know someone who has seen great results with this brand and when I saw their skin I asked them what is their routine/products they use. So I went to Sephora and was trying to figure out which product(s) to try from Inkey List first. WELL I got the oat cleanser complimentary from Influenster & I was SO HAPPY/Excited to try it.  Immediately when I squeezed it out the tube oil came out. The smell isn’t Good. It is a weird bland smell. And as soon as I put it on my face immediately I said oh no this isn’t good. It felt like Vaseline all over my face that wouldn’t rinse off no matter how many times I tried to rinse it off. It didn’t feel clean. I’m so sad to have to write a review saying I don’t like it but I have to be honest. But I definitely will try other Inkey List products. But this is just a NO for me.

For those with sensitive or dry skin, be aware that there seems to be some alcohol in this. Cetearyl Alcohol is an emulsifier and stabilizer for this balm. It is not considered a traditional alcohol that are known for drying the skin.

I have to double cleanse when I use this- meaning I use this to remove makeup and then then go in with a different cleanser to clean my skin. I don’t mind double cleansing as it’s the best way to get your skin completely clean regardless of if you’re using this product or not, but some people won’t like the extra step. As far as other balms I’ve used, this is one of the best. It gets oily, but not run all over your hand oily and it does an INCREDIBLE job at breaking down makeup, including waterproof mascara. However I gave this 4 stars as the packaging could be improved. I liked the idea of a squeeze tube because it is more hygienic than dipping your hand a jar and risking contamination. This balm however is too thick for a squeeze tube and it was extremely hard to get out. I worry that as I get lower on product in the squeeze tube it will be nearly impossible to get any out. The price is very reasonable though! You get a lot of product for a small price and a little goes a long way. This tube will likely last me months and I use this everyday.

So I went to Sephora and was trying to figure out which product(s) to try from Inkey List first. WELL I got the oat cleanser complimentary from Influenster & I was SO HAPPY/Excited to try it.  Immediately when I squeezed it out the tube oil came out. The smell isn’t Good. It is a weird bland smell. And as soon as I put it on my face immediately I said oh no this isn’t good. It felt like Vaseline all over my face that wouldn’t rinse off no matter how many times I tried to rinse it off. It didn’t feel clean.

When mixed with water, it instantly turns into a more creamy texture.Now to breakdown this product’s ingredient list. Most of the ingredients found in this product are used to stabilize it. For those with sensitive or dry skin, be aware that there seems to be some alcohol in this. Cetearyl Alcohol is an emulsifier and stabilizer for this balm. It is not considered a traditional alcohol that are known for drying the skin.

It’s good, but definitely not for me (mainly, because I’m in my 20s, and this felt like it was formulated for more mature skin, or at least for different needs than mine).It was my first time using a dual serum, and though I was initially worried about the oil causing breakouts, it didn’t. My skin was noticeably smoother, and I liked the mild hydration, but for the price point, it just was not worth it. The feel is very silky, which I liked, but the strong perfume smell was very unpleasant. Compared to other serums I’ve used that also had an “anti-aging” claim, I felt this one was not nearly as hydrating or as plumping, though I do feel it gave a good, natural smoothness to skin, that was less shiny. Overall, definitely some strong pros, but the perfume is a major con for me, as is the price.

298530,4,2023-03-01,"I have been using this product for a couple of weeks, as I bought the full size after receiving a free sample when I bought a different drunk elephant product. I like the consistency. It reminds me of the Tatcha water cream. I used to love the tatcha, but for the price, I felt like I would run out so fast, and I also felt like after it absorbed into the skin, it was dry again like the hydration didn’t stay. So I bought this and was very pleased. It is super hydrating, doesn’t have much of an odor, if any, and it leaves me feeling moisturized, but not greasy, all day. I have combo skin, so I worry about becoming super greasy in some areas while remaining dry in others, but in my experience, this works well with both the oily and dry patches in my skin. For reference, I use aveeno foaming face wash with an electronic silicone brush, and then I use the isles of paradise tanning drops mixed in with this serum. Sometimes if my skin really needs a drink, I will use my heavier creams at night, but this usually does the trick as my everyday moisturizer/ hydration serum. (If I don’t need a full heavy cream, but need a little extra umph, I will use aveeno daily moisturizer and combine. This product plays well with others is what I am trying to say (even if it’s not DE brand). The only reason I am not rating it 4 stars is because I don’t know if it works for everyone, and it is a little pricey.

I had to come to the sephora reviews to find out that you need to pry the translucent plastic pinwheel off of the lid just to get the refill to fit in the container and pump properly. Otherwise, the lid does not screw back on correctly and the product doesn’t come out. This info is not included with the instructions, and it also begs the question as to why that piece of plastic needs to be included with the original packaging to begin with.

361792,4,2023-03-15,"It’s true that despite what some claims say, the pilling isn’t dead skin but the product reacting the oils on your skin. Personally, this is not a downside, I just wish it was more honest in the description/sales pitch I got from an Sephora associate. After all, this is primarily a chemical, not physical exfoliant (though it feels a bit like one). In this sense, it can be a good transition product for people who are used to physical exfoliants but want to transition to using AHAs/BHAs, while still having a scrub experience. If you apply to clean, VERY dry skin, it works a lot better, and it did drastically reduce the dry skin I would have on my face over time. My pores were less obvious, and I liked using it on days before going out, so that makeup would apply more smoothly. The biggest downside in my experience was that it’s pretty intense, and I had to decrease my usage by a lot because it was drying out my skin too much (and ironically creating dry skin patches). I still like it and use it, and have even repurchased it, but if you have sensitive skin be careful because it can be too harsh or drying. Because it’s hard to use as often, I don’t see as many results anymore. However, in warmer/more humid seasons it’s a great, fun part of my routine.I definitely recommend to others, when used in moderation, if you want the fun of a physical scrub in chemical exfoliation, and if you’re not put off by the texture (pilling).

364004,4,2023-03-15,"It’s true that despite what some claims say, the pilling isn’t dead skin but the product reacting the oils on your skin. Personally, this is not a downside, I just wish it was more honest in the description/sales pitch I got from an Sephora associate. After all, this is primarily a chemical, not physical exfoliant (though it feels a bit like one). In this sense, it can be a good transition product for people who are used to physical exfoliants but want to transition to using AHAs/BHAs, while still having a scrub experience. If you apply to clean, VERY dry skin, it works a lot better, and it did drastically reduce the dry skin I would have on my face over time. My pores were less obvious, and I liked using it on days before going out, so that makeup would apply more smoothly. The biggest downside in my experience was that it’s pretty intense, and I had to decrease my usage by a lot because it was drying out my skin too much (and ironically creating dry skin patches). I still like it and use it, and have even repurchased it, but if you have sensitive skin be careful because it can be too harsh or drying. Because it’s hard to use as often, I don’t see as many results anymore. However, in warmer/more humid seasons it’s a great, fun part of my routine.I definitely recommend to others, when used in moderation, if you want the fun of a physical scrub in chemical exfoliation, and if you’re not put off by the texture (pilling).

Glowscreen SPF 40 in Sunset and, I must say, I absolutely love it!The product comes in an easy-to-use tube with a pump dispenser, so you can easily apply the product and have a no-mess application process. The Glowscreen itself is a lightweight, creamy-textured sunscreen that lightly blends into skin while providing a great deal of coverage. The accompanying Sunset tint provides a subtle hint of color, just enough to make you look like you were born with a perfect, natural-looking tan!Upon application, the Glowscreen provided excellent coverage without leaving me feeling greasy or heavy. Instead, I felt protected, hydrated, and glowing — all thanks to the amazing ingredients: Green Tea Polyphenols and Vitamin C. The Green Tea Polyphenols provide antioxidant protection from environmental damage, while the Vitamin C helps to brighten and even skin tone.The Glowscreen in Sunset provides an SPF of 40, so my skin was able to fight off the effects of UVA/UVB rays and was left feeling soft and nourished. The best part? I didn’t have to worry about pesky flashback, no matter how close I held my phone camera or the numerous zoom calls I faced.I highly recommend Supergoop!

Sephora luckily listed this as a sample to try in their offer section, so I jumped on this immediately. After 1 use I immediately felt my face smooth and free of any tiny bumps I felt! After 2 or 3 uses (used 2x in a week) my husband said you look like you’re glowing and your face looks even. Now this could be a change in my diet, but I HIGHLY doubt it due to the fact I’ve done this diet before with no facial improvements. I’m honestly sold and will definitely buy after the 7-day samples (which I’m able to cut in half due to the consistency where I don’t have to use a lot… plus).Reasons why I love this:1. Immediate change in facial texture after one use the next day. Smoother skinAfter 2-3 uses: 2. Brighter skin3. Evening skin tone (I’ve had some discoloration in my skin which started in 2020. The sides of my face was darker than the center for some reason. This evened out my skin tone 90%). This alone is why I’m going to rebuy4. Plumper looking face (my husband noticed this)5. A little goes a long way. Love the consistency 6. Maybe very slight tingling the first or second use, but it did not burn. My skin is also not sensitive though. I also don’t use this dailyI absolutely LOVE Farmacy. I’ve tried 5 products so far, and not 1 has let me down!

I’ve dealt with hyperpigmentation for years and I have quite reactive skin so I’m always intrigued by products that can serve multiple purposes without irritating my skin. The texture of this serum is so lovely and light. Unlike other products I’ve tried, this did not sit on top of my skin or leave a slippery residue. It absorbed quickly and was easy to layer with other products. The citrus scent is light and disappeared quickly. While I haven’t noticed a significant reduction in my hyperpigmentation so far, I know my skin takes time to adapt to new products and I’m confident that I’ll see a difference as I keep using it.

It is a nice lightweight, non-greasy formula so maybe I will enjoy it more in the summer when my skin tends to be more oily but for the dry winter months it seems an extra, unnecessary step that isn’t doing a whole lot for my skin. The scent is nice and light, citrus plus maybe vanilla (like a creamsicle scent). My skin can be sensitive to harsh ingredients and perfumes but and I didn’t notice any irritation with this serum.

I find they tend to go off quick and I don’t see much results. So I was extremely thorough with this one given its price point. I started with one pump in the morning and built up to two. My skin is incredibly stubborn when it comes to dark spots and I’ve only seen substantial results with retinol. Until now. I don’t want to be dramatic but my skin loves this stuff! I’ve noticed an evenness in my skin that I haven’t seen in a long time and my stubborn sun spots and acne scarring are fading beautifully. And although I love them- some of my freckles have faded too. I love the subtle scent the product has and the texture is divine. My skin soaks it up. I’m sure my skin would love another bottle- my bank account not so much. So if you’re in the market for a great vitamin C serum and you don’t mind spending more- don’t pass this up.

This CEO 15% Vitamin C Brightening Serum is one step in my gentle routine for acne-prone skin. It’s billed as a multifaceted way to quickly fight the look of dullness, dark spots, and discolorations. And it’s $85 full-price.NGL, I had this serum on my backburner until my esthetician said that higher Vitamin C concentrate equals less breakouts. This was the only bottle I had on hand that clearly enumerated the Vit C percentage, and it was very high. Cheers for brand transparency! Unlike many other serums containing Vitamin C, this one is shelf stable, which means I don’t have to worry too much about it going rancid. The creamlike texture is incredibly gentle and provides hydration. With this and my toner mist, I skip a moisturizer in the morning and head right to sunscreen after this serum. I love these precious extra minutes! It contains glycolic acid, which gently clears out pores without bothering my sensitive skin. In fact, it was another ingredient recommended by my esthetician to deal with stubborn blackheads. The TL;DR? If you are acne-prone and looking to treat dark spots and prevent sun-related aging, this is a great product. If you can get this without breaking the bank, I do suggest it.

It absorbs quickly and doesn’t leave any sticky or greasy residue on my skin. Plus, a little goes a long way, so the bottle lasts for quite a while.But what really sets this serum apart is its powerful blend of ingredients. The 15% Vitamin C, in particular, works wonders on my skin. I’ve noticed a significant improvement in the brightness and clarity of my complexion since incorporating this serum into my routine.Another great thing about the Sunday Riley CEO Brightening Serum is its versatility. It can be used morning or night, and it layers well with other products. I also appreciate that it doesn’t cause any irritation or breakouts, which can be a concern with some brightening products.Overall, I would highly recommend the Sunday Riley CEO Brightening Serum to anyone looking to improve their skin’s brightness and clarity.

Sunday Riley is a brand I have been so curious about, mainly to determine if their higher product price points translate to product effectiveness. I tested the C.E.O 15% Vitamin C Brightening Serum for about 3 weeks.  The formula uses the THD Ascorbate form of Vitamin C which is an extremely stable form of VitaminC. It also has Glycolic Acid, which is one of my favourite skincare ingredients. There are two additional star ingredients that I’m not as familiar with: Phytosterols Complex (helps reduce the look of redness due to skin sensitivity) and Saccharide Isomerate Extract (helps reduce the appearance of pores while reinforcing the skin’s moisture barrier).The packaging is simple and functional. The pump is effective and does not get clogged or leave excess product that dries up at the tip.  The pump also has a locking mechanism, making this a good product to travel with!The consistency of this orange citrus scented serum is like a lightweight moisturizer which surprisingly provides a lot of hydration that I feel normal to oily skin types may not even need a moisturizer. Overall, this is a two thumbs up for me. It gives me an instant glow and brightened my skin tone with consistent use. I found that this product also reduced the appearance of my nose pores and my skin also appeared to look smoother.

Here is how I started. So after washing my face, I let it air dry. Then I started with one pump of serum and increased it to 1.5 pumps. Then I’d use my nighttime hydrating cream and top it up with some face oil. I have very dry skin so I do use multiple hydrating products to keep it soft and supple. After a few days of using the serum regularly, I notice some dry patches on my face but they were gone by the first week. I am still using it every night until about a month to see if it brings any glow because right now I don’t see much difference in my skin glow wise but I notice a slight sensitivity to sunlight. My skin already has photosensitivity issues so when using this product I need to be extra careful. Overall, I like the smell and texture of the product.

437970,5,2023-03-02,"I received this product free from Influenster and Sunday Riley in exchange for my honest review.Firstly, I love that this product is cruelty free and uses a lot of plant based ingredients. This serum contains 15% Vitamin C and is used for brightening dull/uneven textured skin, anti-aging such as: fine lines/wrinkles and dark spots, as well as to help minimize your pores. I loved the light orange scent and creamy texture of this product and the cooling affect I got when applying from a glass bottle. My skin absorbed this immediately! After using for a couple weeks my skin looked brighter and was left with a hydrated, glowy/dewy finish to my skin after every use.

466895,5,2023-03-13,"I needed to write a review on this product because i feel a lot of the bad reviews are people who aren’t using/applying it well. This product has been a game changer for me so once you master this product, you’ll keep buying it. Growing up I never really got much sleep or drank enough water so my biggest concern was the bags under my eyes and two wrinkles forming. I’ve tried so many eye products, and I really thought none would be able to completely get rid of my bags, until I tried this one! It is so hydrating, my skin loves it and my under eye looks plump and so healthy and it stays like that all day. If I don’t use this Kiehl’s product, I noticed my bags immediately. It’s crazy how much of a difference this product makes! I’m in my early 30s and my older sister raved about it, which is what made me buy it, and I’m now on my second tub. Tips for using this product: First off, buy the smaller .05 fl oz size. It’s thick and a little bit goes a longgg way. My first purchase was the larger size,  only used it in the morning and it lasted around 1.5- 2 yrs. However, it did start to separate after awhile so I’d used a little spatula from a previous product to mix it when this happened and the product was just as effective.  Since it’s thick, it doesn’t apply as easy as lighter eye creams. You can’t just smear it under your eye or it will tug at the skin and not spread as far. For application I either put three little dots under my eye and tap it in that way or warm it up between my fingers and then tap it under my eye to apply it. Yes, it takes a little getting used to, but the results are unmatched. Previously, I’ve used both YTP eye creams, ole Heinekens, glow recipe retinol, Estée Lauder advanced repair, and none beat this Kiehl’s product. I’m not even a huge fan of Kiehls, this is their only product that I’ve purchased and will continue to purchase. Ofncourse it’d be nice if it was easier to apply and not separate but the results are amazing so 10/10 recommend.",Creamy Eye Treatment with Avocado,Kiehl's Since 1851,Positive,"['need', 'write', 'review', 'product', 'feel', 'lot', 'bad', 'review', 'people', '’', 'using/applying', 'well', 'product', 'game', 'changer', 'master', 'product', '’', 'keep', 'buying', 'grow', 'never', 'really', 'get', 'much', 'sleep', 'drank', 'enough', 'water', 'big', 'concern', 'bag', 'eye', 'two', 'wrinkle', 'form', '’', 'try', 'many', 'eye', 'product', 'really', 'thought', 'none', 'would', 'able', 'completely', 'get', 'rid', 'bag', 'try', 'one', 'hydrate', 'skin', 'love', 'eye', 'look', 'plump', 'healthy', 'stay', 'like', 'day', '’', 'use', 'kiehl', '’', 'product', 'notice', 'bag', 'immediately', '’', 'crazy', 'much', 'difference', 'product', 'make', '’', 'early', '30', 'old', 'sister', 'rave', 'make', 'buy', '’', 'second', 'tub', 'tip', 'use', 'product', 'first', 'buy', 'small', '.05', 'fl', 'oz', 'size', '’', 'thick', 'little', 'bit', 'go', 'longgg', 'way', 'first', 'purchase', 'large', 'size', 'use', 'morning', 'last', 'around', '1.5-', '2', 'yr', 'however', 'start', 'separate', 'awhile', '’', 'use', 'little', 'spatula', 'previous', 'product', 'mix', 'happen', 'product', 'effective', 'since', '’', 'thick', '’', 'apply', 'easy', 'lighter', 'eye', 'cream', '’', 'smear', 'eye', 'tug', 'skin', 'spread', 'far', 'application', 'either', 'put', 'three', 'little', 'dot', 'eye', 'tap', 'way', 'warm', 'finger', 'tap', 'eye', 'apply', 'yes', 'take', 'little', 'get', 'use', 'result', 'unmatched', 'previously', '’', 'use', 'ytp', 'eye', 'cream', 'ole', 'heinekens', 'glow', 'recipe', 'retinol', 'estée', 'lauder', 'advanced', 'repair', 'none', 'beat', 'kiehl', '’', 'product', '’', 'even', 'huge', 'fan', 'kiehls', 'product', '’', 'purchase', 'continue', 'purchase', 'ofncourse', '’', 'nice', 'easy', 'apply', 'separate', 'result', 'amaze', '10/10', 'recommend']",Neutral,Positive,need write review product feel lot bad review people ’ using/applying well product game changer master product ’ keep buying grow never really get much sleep drank enough water big concern bag eye two wrinkle form ’ try many eye product really thought none would able completely get rid bag try one hydrate skin love eye look plump healthy stay like day ’ use kiehl ’ product notice bag immediately ’ crazy much difference product make ’ early 30 old sister rave make buy ’ second tub tip use product first buy small .05 fl oz size ’ thick little bit go longgg way first purchase large size use morning last around 1.5- 2 yr however start separate awhile ’ use little spatula previous product mix happen product effective since ’ thick ’ apply easy lighter eye cream ’ smear eye tug skin spread far application either put three little dot eye tap way warm finger tap eye apply yes take little get use result unmatched previously ’ use ytp eye cream ole heinekens glow recipe retinol estée lauder advanced repair none beat kiehl ’ product ’ even huge fan kiehls product ’ purchase continue purchase ofncourse ’ nice easy apply separate result amaze 10/10 recommend,2,,

475123,5,2023-03-15,"Very impressed with TO’s Rosehip Oil. I’ve used many in the past but none with this texture. When I apply this (3 drops on a night time) it sinks in within seconds as though it was never there! It doesn’t even ’feel’ like an oil when applying, almost like a water-in-oil. Hard to describe and something you can only appreciate once you’ve tried it for yourself. Having said that, I believe it depends on the batch you get as there are natural variations in aroma, color and texture with each one. Mine was 1B02 which is printed in blue ink near the bottom of the bottle, on the glass itself. Also unlike other Rosehip oils I’ve used in the past, this one doesn’t smell of anything unless I really put my nose up close and even then it’s very faint.  As for the benefits, I love the hydration I get from this and how it gradually fades acne marks. Love the simple fuss-free packaging and easy to use dropper that allows for a measured, precise dispensing of the oil. The only thing I don’t like, having a few TO products in rotation is that they all look identical at a glance and I’ve often started to apply one before realizing it isn’t what I thought it was. The writing on the label is also quite small which doesn’t help. But these are minor points, the bottom line is it works and is UNIQUE compared to the many Rosehip oils I’ve used over the years.

I have the beginnings of laugh lines so I was very excited when I got the offer to try out Lancome’s face serum for free. I’ve always heard great things about Genifique. My first impression of the Genifique is that it goes on nice and smoothly. It doesn’t make your skin feel oily but instead gives it a nice hydrated feel. It’s a lightweight serum that would be especially perfect in the hot, humid Louisiana heat. Over the course of the week and a half that I used the Genifique I felt like for at least the time immediately after applying the serum it felt like my slight laugh lines were barely noticeable. I can’t say that I saw a huge difference but I really don’t have any wrinkles so it’s hard to speak to how well it diminishes the appearance of fine line and wrinkles. My mother is of a more mature age and says that she sees a noticeable difference in the appearance of her fine lines and wrinkles. I’d be willing to try the product out longer to see if I notice more of a difference. For someone my age and for the price I don’t think I would necessarily recommend this product unless the person has a big problem with fine lines and wrinkles.

486396,3,2023-03-07,"First, I’ll say that I don’t dislike this serum. I have supremely dry skin and typically use much thicker serums, but even with this product’s sort of light consistency I find it very moisturizing after cleansing. Not moisturizing enough to use alone for me, but I can tell it’s more than just glycerin in a bottle. It plays well under many of my go-to moisturizers (Farmacy’s Honey Halo, presently) and I’ve never had a problem with it under makeup. I am currently experiencing skin texture/mild acne and I’m not blaming this product, but it didn’t do much to smooth texture flare-ups on my skin. Though, it is very good at keeping things moisturized, and the parts of my face that aren’t prone to redness/irritation/acne are doing FABULOSULY.I bought this on sale and have been using it for about 3 months. At first, I was using it both day and night, then I realized it had Vitamin C and it actually makes no sense to use at night, despite the instructions on the bottle. I didn’t notice a difference when I went down to once a day, and I am a bit peeved that Lancome suggests twice daily usage on such an expensive serum.  I don’t regret the purchase (especially at 50% off), but I don’t think I will buy it full-price when I run out at this point in my life. If my texture were due solely to signs of aging (fine-lines, sun damage) etc. I think I would definitely consider it as a highly moisturizing, non-irritating DAYTIME serum.

This primer gives me an amazing pink pearl glow that really made my skin pop. It is the perfect base for my makeup, giving me a luminous complexion that lasts all day.What I love most about this product is that it not only looks great, but it’s also good for my skin. The hyaluronic acid and vitamin B5 provides long-lasting hydration, leaving my skin feeling soft and supple. The niacinamide helps to even out my skin tone and reduce the appearance of my pores, which is always a plus. And the cocoa peptides protects my skin from blue-light damage, which is something I never knew I needed in a primer.I also appreciate that this product is fragrance-free, paraben-free, sulfate-free, cruelty-free, and gluten-free. It’s important to me to use products that are good for my skin and good for the environment, and Supergoop! Glowscreen fits the bill.Overall, I highly recommend Supergoop! Glowscreen SPF 40 in the shade “Dawn“ to anyone looking for a primer that provides a beautiful glow while also protecting and hydrating the skin.

Glowscreen SPF 40 in Sunset and, I must say, I absolutely love it!The product comes in an easy-to-use tube with a pump dispenser, so you can easily apply the product and have a no-mess application process. The Glowscreen itself is a lightweight, creamy-textured sunscreen that lightly blends into skin while providing a great deal of coverage. The accompanying Sunset tint provides a subtle hint of color, just enough to make you look like you were born with a perfect, natural-looking tan!Upon application, the Glowscreen provided excellent coverage without leaving me feeling greasy or heavy. Instead, I felt protected, hydrated, and glowing — all thanks to the amazing ingredients: Green Tea Polyphenols and Vitamin C. The Green Tea Polyphenols provide antioxidant protection from environmental damage, while the Vitamin C helps to brighten and even skin tone.The Glowscreen in Sunset provides an SPF of 40, so my skin was able to fight off the effects of UVA/UVB rays and was left feeling soft and nourished. The best part? I didn’t have to worry about pesky flashback, no matter how close I held my phone camera or the numerous zoom calls I faced.I highly recommend Supergoop!

528384,3,2023-03-05,"This Glow Recipe Avocado Ceramide Recovery Serum was gifted to me by Glow Recipe and Skeepers. This serum was designed to reduce visible redness and support the skin barrier, both things I need help with. So of course I was excited to try it. I have been using this for a little while now. It feels instantly soothing on the skin. I do notice an almost instant reduction of redness after application. That’s unfortunately not super long lasting, at least not in the limited time I have been trying it. I would suppose more lasting effects would take time to achieve.  The soothing effects on the skin is more long lasting though. The texture of the serum is interesting. It is milky and a little thicker than a lot of serums.

554333,2,2023-03-08,"I got a farmacy kit during the last vib sale and I was excited to use it after seeing many great reviews for this moisturizer. I have very dry, dehydrated skin. The kind of dryness where if I wash my face I immediately need to follow with my skincare routine otherwise my skin gets super dry and tight. At first I thought it was a good moisturizer and it smelled nice. It is thick and moisturizing but not to the point where my dryness necessarily went away. I had been using it for weeks, just hitting the halfway point in the pot and then came the acne. At first I thought it was just hormones but it was constant and nothing made it better. Finally I put two and two together and stopped using this moisturizer my acne gradually started to calm down. It gave me both types of acne, horrible cystic acne deep in my skin which was painful and tiny little bumps/clogged pores(not whiteheads). All of the acne was along my jaw area and sometimes on my upper neck under my jaw where I would take the product down. Unfortunately for me I also have the type of skin that immediately scars when I get bigger acne bumps and now I’m left with a bunch of dark spots along my jawline that I now have to find a good vitamin c to get rid of. If you have acne prone skin please get a sample or a smaller size to try out first if you even want to risk it. I wish I had taken the acne reviews seriously but I thought it couldn’t happen to me. I almost never write reviews either but I feel I should for those considering this who are acne prone.

554336,5,2023-03-07,"I have incredibly dry skin and probably try 3-5 facial moisturizers every year. The kind of dry skin where you need a dedicated moisturizer that you use both night and day, because you’ve never found a SPF-infused moisturizer that works well enough so you just resign yourself to buying a really big tub of moisturizer and another SPF whose formulation you pray doesn’t pill with it.  Sometimes I find moisturizers that I really like or found non-offensive, but by the end of the tub it  was hard to justify the price based on the so-so performance (looking at you Tatcha Dewy skin) OR I started out loving it but then my skin has decided it wasn’t all that great and I’m better off just putting Curel on my face until I find something new. I bought the smallest tub of this in November ’22 thanks to a fellow-shopper who raved about it to try it out. All moisturizers feel amazing in the store with that little back of the hand test we all do, but this felt...different? My skin felt like it had ’slip’...like I put conditioner in it and could detangle it lol.  A lot of people complain about ’tackiness’ in moisturizers, but for those of us whose skin gets tight and flaky if we don’t put anything on .02 seconds after cleansing, you know that tackiness is a moisture barrier that will transform from “tacky“ to moisturized if you just wait 10 seconds. This product does that. My skin feels crazy hydrated all day. I wake up with soft well-moisturized skin in the morning. And my skin hasn’t rejected it now that I’m on my second bottle (I went back for the 1.7 size). I’m almost down to the end of this tub and I’m looking forward to buying the 3.4oz size next time. I can confidently say that’s never happened to me with any other face lotion. For the first time I don’t feel like browsing more expensive options in the hopes they’ll provide something I’m missing, because Honey Halo hits all the marks!
