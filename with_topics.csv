31,2,2023-03-12,"I really loved this product and did use the whole thing, it lasted over 6 months and I thought did a decent job. The only problem is that I noticed part of my lip started to get super dry and no matter how much I used, how frequently I reapplied, exfoliated my lips, it did not get better. Nothing else in my routine changed except for adding this product in so this did cause my lips to dry out and didn’t fix it.

33,2,2023-03-12,In my opinion it’s very over hyped. It’s not very moisturizing (I prefer Tarte Jelly Glaze over this and it’s also half the price) which is the whole point. It’s not horrible but it’s not good either.

42,5,2023-03-09,"I’ve never used this kind of product, I tend to be very minimalist. After 1 night, I was already so impressed I had it mailed to a girlfriend as a gift. as far as scents go, if you’re shopping online - all of the other ones are strong smells, it all smells like 90s chapstick.

54,3,2023-03-07,"This product is marketed as a sleeping mask but i would say its more of a lip balm. It doesnt hydrate at all so dont turn to this looking to help dry lips.

A big caveat is that if I’m not drinking water (ie. that time I lost my water bottle for three days), there is no amount of lip balm that will fix my dry lips. Also, if you like the Japanese grape flavour, this is what the balm smells like exactly. Which in my case, is the perfect scenario. Not greasy or sticky and no flavour if you eat it.

Hasta que vi un video de alguien q probaba algunos de estos aceites para limpiar primero el maquillaje. Yo pensé q era como limpiase con aceite de coco que es toda una situación engorrosa donde después sacarte ese aceite es un lio. Pero es cero como eso, una vez lo mezclas con el agua básicamente se hace agua y se te va. No entiendo la química de esto pero es maravilloso y funciona. Ahora he vuelto a usar rímel a diario porque sacármelo con este aceite es súper sencillo. No puedo compararlo con otros porque el único q he usado es este y de un sample size que pedi en una compra que hice. Pretendo comprarlo? si seguro. También quisiera probar uno de clinic que vi que es muy bueno y tienen uno que es pequeño y cuesta 14 dólares así si no te gusta, almenos no gastaste tanto.

My face was tingling and burning for hours afterward, and the gross scent would not go away.  Miserable.  Painful.Even worse, this has an extremely thin, slippery texture.

This cream moisturizes my skin and keeps it plump and soft without over- drying, feeling sticky, and/or pilling under my makeup.  Luckily, it also does not cause me to break out. Only downsides are the price tag and the applicator. Rather than dipping your finger in the container to get the cream out, you have to press down on the green plastic cover that sits on top of the white container. By the way, you can physically remove that green cover if you’re no longer getting any product to come out. There will be some cream hidden around the corners of the container, good for a few more days of use. At that price, I will use every last drop of this cream.

It just burned and made my skin feel like it was worse off for having used the cream. If you have even slightly sensitive skin, I would skip this one.

Second application was like liquid fire on my skin. I had an immediate reaction that caused my face to turn bright red and burn so intensely that I was in tears, I tried everything to get it to stop, but everything I tried made it worse. Simply touching my face caused agonizing pain. The pain subsided after about 45 minutes, but it left red, splotchy, scabby skin all over my face. I’ve had a bad chemical burn on my arm from a few years ago, and this looks almost identical to that.

I personally feel like I’m starting to look it faster and faster these days. I was looking for a product to help smooth fine lines and wrinkles, and of course slow the clock down as much as possible. Due to the rave reviews I have read about Sunday Riley, especially the Luna, I was excited to try all of her products. Around Christmas I purchased 2 of the “go to bed with me“ sets. I felt like this was a good cost effective measure to get a real test run on the whole system (cleanser, essence, A+, 5 star, Luna, Good Genes and Ice). $200 later and a few months, I’m here to report that I’m not impressed. I’m not sure what the hype is about. I didn’t see any improvement from the A+, 5 star, Luna, Ice, or Good Genes. Maybe it is just not right for my skin but I honestly think whether it was “right“ for me or not, there should have been some effect or minor improvement. My only other complaint is about the Luna, it doesn’t soak in, you go to bed slimy. On the other hand, the two products I didn’t expect to really care about but ended up really liking are the essence (Pink Drink) and the cleanser (Ceramic Slip). Still, I don’t expect I will be purchasing them. It’s a consideration in the future.

It is also on the pricier side, but I find I only need to use a few pea-sized dots of it each time so the full size will last me a long time.

733,3,2023-03-18,I usually use the small tubs and I absolutely love them. They are hydrating and can turn dry chapped lips overnight for a plump and hydrated finish. The tube however I think for better flow has a different formulation. It does not offer the same hydration and repair as the tubs.

It is not sticky at all, you can put it on your lips without putting Vaseline as a base! The scent is amazing and does not give me a headache and I constantly reach for it.

The texture of the cream was thick but not greasy. I wouldn’t say it absorbed quickly, but it did leave my skin feeling hydrated and smooth. I did not like using it as a primer as it felt sticky too long for my quick (usually last minute) morning routines. Overall it’s not something I’d spend the price tag on.

A little does truly go a long way.  No residue.  Within a few treatments, you’ll notice your skin firm up, a glow develop and lines fade.  I believe the hype.At a price in the $50s range, this isn’t cheap.  But you pay for what you get.  I’d happily buy the large canister moving forward just to keep this in my personal rotation.

Upon opening this product the smell reminded me of an elevated “ponds” cream. It was almost nostalgic to smell. I applied to my skin and it instantly soaked in. Not greasy and very hydrating. I wanted to use for a few weeks before I wrote this review. It did not break me out and gave me a nice glow. For the price, I think other products work just as well for less. I did, though, enjoy trying",Magic Cream Moisturizer with Hyaluronic Acid,Charlotte Tilbury,Positive,

It is a nice moisturizer but the “glow“ that it gives just looks oily or shiny to me which I’m not a huge fan of.

I typically use lighter, Korean skincare brands that leave my skin glowy and dewy and I don’t find that this product comes even close to those. It is heavily scented and smells like what I would describe as “grandma perfume”. For the price point, I would expect more product, or for it to last longer. Three weeks in, I can’t imagine what I have left lasting for more than another week or two. The products I’m used to using are a lower price point and include double or more of the product. It seems to have a lot of great reviews, so maybe it’s just not ideal for my skin, but for a product that has magic in the name, I expected magical results and did not get them. I won’t be purchasing in the future.",Magic Cream Moisturizer with Hyaluronic Acid,Charlotte Tilbury,Positive,

At first I was concerned because the cream is very thick and I don’t do well with heavy creams even though I need the moisture because I have super dry skin. However, the thickness of this cream does not affect the oiliness of my skin. I honestly thought this would only work as a night cream. I was so wrong. This adds so much moisture to my dry skin and I now use it every single day. My makeup goes on very smoothly after I use this cream as well. I wait about 20 minutes for the cream to set in before I apply my makeup and it looks fabulous. I will definitely purchase.this again even though the price.is higher than I prefer.

I had high hopes because Im in the early stages with Tretinoin and the peeling is... rough. Anyway, while it’s not “magic“, its actually pretty nice. A tiny bit goes a long way, the scent actually grew on me, and there is actually a nice moisturized result with no greasy feel. Plus, the company sells refills for the jar which cuts down on waste (and cost).",Magic Cream Moisturizer with Hyaluronic Acid,Charlotte Tilbury,Positive,

866,4,2023-03-11,"I adore Charlotte Tilbury lipsticks and foundation, but never tried her skincare line until now. Charlotte’s Magic Cream really lives up to its name. Everything from the box to the glass jar feels luxurious. I loved the fact that there was so much information on the box, and even the little heart in the corner made it feel so special. I am a sucker for a good packaging. The glass jar itself feels very high end, and it’s a fitting container for such an amazing cream! It looks a bit thick at first glance, but as soon as you spread it around on your face, it feels really lightweight and my skin just immediately looks dewy and hydrated. I have stubborn little fine lines on my forehead, and whenever I put on foundation it looked very dry and the lines looked very exaggerated, But with this cream I can see how every subsequent product I put on (sunscreen, primer, foundation and powder) all seem to blend seemlessly, and my face just looks healthy! I may consider purchasing the refills in the future. It’s one of the other things I love about this product - you can buy refills and just use the amazing jar as long as you can.The cream isn’t overwhelming fragranced, but does lightly smell like rose. Even with fragrance I haven’t had any issues and my skin is very sensitive. Would definitely recommend!",Magic Cream Moisturizer with Hyaluronic Acid,Charlotte Tilbury,Positive,
867,4,2023-03-11,I gave this Magic Cream 4 stars. The packaging is a sturdy glass jar with a gold lid that looks great on any vanity. I think the cream is hydrating. It does have a mild fragrance so maybe not for super sensitive skin types. The package didn’t really state any additional skin benefits beyond being a moisturizer. For the price point I would have liked to see some extra benefits or multitasking product. It’s a decent anti-aging tool to have on your vanity.,Magic Cream Moisturizer with Hyaluronic Acid,Charlotte Tilbury,Positive,

869,5,2023-03-11,I recieved this product from Influenster and Charlotte Tilbury for an honest review. I will start by saying it is the best moisturizer I have used hands down. I have 48 year old skin and I use retinoid daily so I was having problems with dry skin and peeling. Not anymore. This is a thick texture with a slight scent. It does everything it claims. I use this morning and night and my skin feels more hydrated and plump and I can literally get away without a primer under my makeup. It does not cause any movement of the makeup and helps the application. The packaging is beautiful and the ingredients are amazing. I am truly blown away. I have used hundreds of moisturizers but this one is a holy grail. This is magic you dont wanna pass up! HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND!,Magic Cream Moisturizer with Hyaluronic Acid,Charlotte Tilbury,Positive,

This cream is magical all around. First off, the refillable glass jar is gorgeous and and thick and looks as if it is forged out of crystal. This is definitely a moisturizer you will want to have displayed on your counter or your skincare/makeup desk. This cream has amazing ingredients that are all proven skincare superstars, and the way they are combined in this formula is, indeed, pure magic. It has a light scent and goes on so smoothly with no greasy feel at all. It hydrates, plumps, tightens, minimizes pores, and leaves your skin perfectly primed for makeup. To have all these benefits in one cream is amazing! My skin looks so dewy and fresh that I have gone several days without even using foundation! If you’re on the fence about buying this (it is on the more expensive side at $65/ounce) just trust the hype and give it a try!

This is my first time trying this brand and now I can see what all the hype is about. The Magic Cream Moisturizer is so unique and amazing. First, the packaging is luxurious and beautiful. The cream has a very light rose scent. The texture is unique and is on the thicker side. Since it is thicker, only a little amount is needed to do the trick. I see this jar lasting awhile. It applies smooth and melts right into skin.  It doesn’t feel one bit heavy or oily.  I have combination skin and I really love how the cream makes my skin feel. My skin looks so radiant and hydrated right upon application. It really gives a youthful glow. It wears so well under makeup and it doubles as a primer.  Lastly, it leaves my skin feeling baby smooth. This cream claims to reduce the look of wrinkles and firm the skin in 8 weeks. I will keep you posted on the progress. The key ingredients are hyaluronic acids, vitamin C + E, and bionymph peptide complex. Overall, I’m surprised how much I love this cream.  My favorite thing about the magic cream is the radiance it gives my skin, how smooth it makes my skin, and that it doubles as a makeup primer!

881,5,2023-03-09,"I received this item from Influenster and Charlotte Tilbury, in exchange for my honest (very honest) review. Full disclosure, I am mostly a La Mer girlie who enjoys a lot of moisturizing power in my creams. I have a lot of dryness especially around my eyes that I treat with good moisturizers that pack a punch in terms of hydration.I got a sample of the CT eye cream once and loved it enough to buy the full size. I’ve tried the CT magic night cream and the regular CT magic cream and both are good but not miraculous, in my opinion. But as the CT eye cream has become a staple for me, I was curious to see what this CT magic cream with hyaluronic acid felt like. When I first placed it on my skin, it felt luxurious. Definitely creamy. The consistency is almost as thick as La Mer. It also has a heavenly smell. The payoff in terms of hydration for the next day was great. I used the cream for 4 days straight and was super impressed by the way my skin felt. I think it does work on reducing wrinkles because my face looked really good and smooth! I was really in shock by the result after so few days. As far as working as a primer, I’m sure it’d be amazing. But I like it more for just sitting on the face alone to moisturize overnight. To me, in order to add a cream to my routine, it has to (1) serve a function like anti-aging or  moisturize and make my skin hydrated (2) smell good and (3) have resourceful packaging. This cream ticks all those boxes. At the price point, it is extremely valuable. This cream could easily go for $98 and still be worth it. I recommend. 8/10.",Magic Cream Moisturizer with Hyaluronic Acid,Charlotte Tilbury,Positive,

LOL I’m 40 years old so I understand the younger women might have no idea what I’m talking about, but if you’re my age... honestly.. it’s kinda crazy to me that this is $100 for something that feels almost the same as a $15 for 2oz competitor. I dunno... I’m having a hard time being impressed with this one for the outrageous price.

924,3,2023-03-05,"Works beautifully as a face base, prior to applying makeup. Will have makeup looking great all day! As a moisturizer, it’s mediocre. It’s mostly oils. Although it contains, humectants, Antioxidants, and peptides, it’s in low doses. Makes skin LOOK hydrated, but doesn’t feel like it’s hydrating skin deep; appears to just sit on the surface. When I apply to my skin, it doesn’t dissolve until I rub it in, letting me to believe it just sits on top of the skin. Has a consistency like soft cold-pressed oil. Very little spreads effortlessly over the skin. Can work for most skin types; wouldn’t recommend for milia-prone skin though. No irritating scent. Again, great face base, but as a moisturizer, I notice no real benefits. For the cost, I personally won’t be purchasing in the future.

Very thick but not greasy. Hydrating without feeling like it clogs my pores. Glides over the skin and rubs in really well. Sits nicely under my SPF and foundation. Mild scent like lux products.

The packaging is beautiful with it’s sturdy glass jar and gold lid and I love that it contains ingredients such as hyaluronic acid and vitamins c, e, and bionymph peptides which are supposed to aid in hydration as well as skin health such as smoothness and wrinkles. However, it did the opposite for me. The cream has a thicker texture almost like sunscreen which left my skin with a slight greasy feeling that never fully absorbed no matter the amount applied. The overall results left my skin with breakouts and feeling very dry which became worst with continued use. With that said, it just was not right for my skin.",Magic Cream Moisturizer with Hyaluronic Acid,Charlotte Tilbury,Positive,
939,4,2023-03-04,"I am going to be honest here. I am a big fan of Charlotte Tilbury. I have eyeshadow, blush, highlight, and face powder and they are all favorites.  In skincare though, I’ve only tried the eye serum and found it nice but not life changing.This cream wasn’t what I expected. The packaging is beautiful. The cream itself is thick- this jar is going to last me forever. Even though it was thick it didn’t feel heavy on the skin- it blended seamlessly and dried down super fast. It hydrated my skin overnight and worked well before makeup. This cream is really nice- like annoyingly nice. I don’t want to like it bc it is expensive nice haha.I will say that I would probably put a serum under this bc my skin is so dry, but unless you have really dry skin you wouldn’t need to. It is heavily fragranced but didn’t irritate my skin at all.So if you were curious, I’d recommend it.

The only issue I experienced was after a few hours, you could see my pores.

The texture is thick but spread super easy and absorb into skin fast. Highly recommend this cream.,Magic Cream Moisturizer with Hyaluronic Acid,Charlotte Tilbury,Positive,
969,3,2023-03-01,"This is a perfectly fine product if you like a luxury face cream. There are no special ingredients. The packaging is weighty, but of course the cap will show fingerprints. It is medium-heavily scented - rose with a kind of lemongrass/citronella undertone - but it dissipates quickly. The texture is thick but there are definitely emollients that make it apply with a more silky feel. There was nothing I disliked about the product. I tested this side-by-side (split face/neck) with my old reliable, Vanicream, and the results over ~4 weeks were exactly the same. No additional moisture, glow, or other factors. So while I don’t dislike it, I would never go out and purchase. I prefer the results I get layering Vanicream or Stratia Liquid Gold with Saint Jane CBD Oil (which also smells amazing).",Magic Cream Moisturizer with Hyaluronic Acid,Charlotte Tilbury,Positive,

973,4,2023-03-01,I tried this product out after receiving this in exchange for an honest review and this is about a 4 star moisturizing cream. I don’t like the smell as it reminds me of a cleaner scent or a cheap acne cream smell. The cream does melt into the skin and I admit its not heavy so if u can ignore the scent and need a light moisture creme this is for you!,Magic Cream Moisturizer with Hyaluronic Acid,Charlotte Tilbury,Positive,
974,5,2023-03-01,I received this product for free from Influenster in exchange for an honest review. I have eyed up this product for a long time and could never but the bullet on purchasing it I instead convinced myself I didn’t need it. Well then I got this product and now I don’t know how I can go without it. The amount of moisture this provides is insane. It’s creamy but not sticky like some moisturizers are. It soaks right into my skin and melts right in instantly. My make up applies smoother and my dry patches are going down. Thankfully you only need a small amount to feel these amazing benefits so it’ll last a long time. I will now be buying this as my daily moisturizer.,Magic Cream Moisturizer with Hyaluronic Acid,Charlotte Tilbury,Positive,
975,4,2023-03-01,Thank you to Influenster for my first Charlotte Tilbury product- I was very pleasantly surprised with the quality and level of hydration I got from this moisturizer day/night!

976,5,2023-03-01,"I absolutely adore Charlotte Tilbury lipsticks and foundation, but never tried her skincare line until now. Charlotte’s Magic Cream really lives up to its name. Everything from the box to the glass jar feels luxurious. I loved the fact that there was so much information on the very stylish box, and even the little heart in the corner made it feel so special. I am a sucker for a good packaging. The glass jar itself feels so nice, and it’s a fitting vessel for such an amazing cream! The cream doesn’t have any overwhelming scent, it just smells really clean, if that makes sense. I think because of it’s ingredients and the lack of any fragrance makes it really suitable for any skin type, even sensitive ones. It looks a bit thick at first glance, but as soon as you spread it around onnyour face, it feels really lightweight and my skin just immediately looks glowier. I have stubborn little fine lines on my forehead, and whenever I put on foundation it looked very dry and the lines looked very exaggerated. But with this amazing cream I can see how every subsequent product I put on (sunscreen, primer, foundation and powder) all seem to blend seemlessly, and my face just looks healthy and glowy. I would definitely be purchasing the refills in the future. It’s one of the other things I love about this product - you can but refills and just use the amazing jar as long as you can. Would definitely recommend!",Magic Cream Moisturizer with Hyaluronic Acid,Charlotte Tilbury,Positive,

1169,1,2023-03-06,"I ordered this cream about a year ago and I loved it at first. Then, shortly into using this product, I started to develop an acne-like rash that would not go away no matter what I did. I had never struggled with acne before and my skin looked terrible so I was concerned. I went to the dermatologist and was diagnosed with perioral dermatitis. The doctor said this can be caused by certain moisturizers. I emailed tatcha and was told it might not work for every skin type but it was dermatologist tested so I thought maybe my skin was just too sensitive for it. I gave the rest of the product to my friend since I could no longer use it, and shortly after he developed periocular dermatitis. It was so strange that the same condition happened to both of us within months and the only connection we can make is this moisturizer. It’s also strange because this condition happens mostly in women and he is a man. We had to get on antibiotics and use a prescription cream and it was such a pain to get rid of. I DO NOT recommend this product. There are so many amazing and clean products out there and this is not one of them.

It may be better for dry or mature skin; I have normal skin. It does feel great on my dry areas, like elbows and heels. A little goes a very long way, and I’d recommend emulsifying the product before use by warming it in your hand and rubbing it before applying so that it isn’t quite so thick and pore clogging.

1180,5,2023-03-13,"I joined the community as a public service announcement for how good this cream is. I never buy any cream twice as I always feel there is something better for my aging wrinkling, large pore, dry but easily clogged skin. This is fantastic. I have now bought it for the third time. Do not buy the gel version it is not moisturizing enough and I had to return it. It may make your skin a touch red so sunscreen is a must as with any vitamin C product but I realize there is nothing like this for making my skin look WAY younger. Wrinkles pretty much disappear almost on the first use. The nice thing is you can try it in the store and not have to order it to know if it works for you. I got a small sample of it and when I put it on my husband said “wow what did you do?“ I’m not making any of this up. It sounds like a too good to be true review but I have literally wasted thousands on creams. I don’t want to mention that it made me slightly red because then you might keep looking but honestly the touch of red is sooooo worth it to be 10 years younger. People need to try this. I hope this helps you. I wasted so much money at creams at sephora before finding this, drunk elephant no, squalane oil themed creams no, clinique redness no, clarins oil no, josie maran whipped pretty excellent but not as good as this, origins planscriptions is garbage, anyway too many to list but you get the idea.

I was left with a ton of pustules, my cheeks were swollen, and now sensitive redness and texture are left behind.  I really hope I don’t have lasting scaring from this.

1229,5,2023-03-03,I thought I had an exfoliator that I loved and after using this product I have come to realize I had no idea what I was missing!! The results after just one use are astounding. My skin is dramatically smoother already and I have faith it’s going to continue to get better. There is a slight tingle during the 2 minute waiting process but it’s nothing painful at all.

It is perfect to use it twice per week.",ExfoliKate Intensive Pore Exfoliating Treatment,Kate Somerville,Positive,

I do see a difference in my pores they are most definitely smaller and it has helped my acne. Highly recommend.,ExfoliKate Intensive Pore Exfoliating Treatment,Kate Somerville,Positive,

It really helped with the texture of my skin back then, so of course I had to try it again after so many years. I didn’t take the best care of my skin this last winter and now I’m doing damage control. Just a few uses of this treatment once again has made a big difference in how soft my skin feels and the overall dullness is gone. I know this treatment is pricey but trust me, it really works great!

This a mask that contains lactic acid, papaya, pineapple, and pumpkin enzymes, to aid in skin exfoliation. This is an intensive mask that you apply to the skin and remove after 2 minutes. I’ve used it twice and so far I’ve not had any issues. I like applying it before getting into the shower and washing it off after a minute. Once I’m done, this leaves my skin feeling smooth. It does dry out my skin, so I make sure to moisturize once I’m done and it helps.So far, I’m loving this mask and it’s working for me.",ExfoliKate Intensive Pore Exfoliating Treatment,Kate Somerville,Positive,

1244,4,2023-03-02,"Really liked this exfoliating treatment and am on the cautious side only using it once a week since I have sensitive skin. It left my skin feeling super clear and soft and felt as though it absorbed and held onto my moisturizer well. For the price it’s pretty steep for an exfoliant though it’s a large quantity. Since I don’t use this more than 1-2x a week, I would purchase a smaller quantity for a lower price since skincare has a set life after opening.",ExfoliKate Intensive Pore Exfoliating Treatment,Kate Somerville,Positive,

It has a fresh/clean scent that doesn’t bother me, but just a heads up if you’re sensitive to smells.  Left my skin soft and flake-free, no irritation. I don’t feel like it was over-exfoliating, or over-drying. but definitely use it only 1-2 times a week like the directions say, I feel like I’d be cracked / chapped otherwise!

This creates an undesirable look while wearing make up. This exfoliating product takes care of my dry, flaky skin and reveals soft skin underneath. I love using this product on a biweekly basis as part of my make up removing routine. I begin with an oil cleanser, then I follow up with two rounds of facial cleanser before utilizing this exfoliating treatment to completely cleanse and refresh my skin. I can see results immediately, and the skin care that I apply afterwards is able to absorb seamlessly. Overall, I love this product, and I am very impressed.

It has that oatmeal/hypoallergenic smell that I can’t get past. I have to hold my breath when I apply it. I’ll use up the rest of it but I won’t repurchase it.

I used it the second time to try to remove some eye makeup and it felt more like I was smearing it around.

I bought it because you can’t beat the price/oz--- it’s a huge bottle, but I don’t like it very much. It tends to separate in the bottle, which makes it hard to use. After a few months of use the top of the bottle is slimy because somehow the product drips out even though I try to close it well. If I store it without the top down then it separates even more. I use this as a first cleanse, but I can’t imagine using it alone since there is always a film after use even after rinsing.",Oat Cleansing Balm,The INKEY List,Positive,

1311,4,2023-03-16,This product is thick! Definitely comes out as a balm and rubbing it between your palms becomes more of a cleansing oil. It will help remove your makeup and impurities while hydrating and pre-cleansing the skin. I recommend using another cleanser afterwards. But as a pre-cleanser you definitely can tell it adds hydration. I enjoyed it more than I thought I would because it does remove my make up and rinse is cleared with my second cleansing. I’m 38 and find that a little extra hydration goes along way for me these days. If you’re looking for a way to keep your skin hydrated without a ton of lotions  this is a great option. I also love that it doesn’t have any intense fragrance.,Oat Cleansing Balm,The INKEY List,Positive,

1328,4,2023-03-14,"Let me start off by saying I LOVE this product, but I could see how it wouldn’t be for everyone.This is a cleansing balm meant to remove makeup and leaving the skin feeling soft, but this is definitely not a one and done kind of product. I have to double cleanse when I use this- meaning I use this to remove makeup and then then go in with a different cleanser to clean my skin. I don’t mind double cleansing as it’s the best way to get your skin completely clean regardless of if you’re using this product or not, but some people won’t like the extra step. As far as other balms I’ve used, this is one of the best. It gets oily, but not run all over your hand oily and it does an INCREDIBLE job at breaking down makeup, including waterproof mascara. However I gave this 4 stars as the packaging could be improved. I liked the idea of a squeeze tube because it is more hygienic than dipping your hand a jar and risking contamination. This balm however is too thick for a squeeze tube and it was extremely hard to get out. I worry that as I get lower on product in the squeeze tube it will be nearly impossible to get any out. The price is very reasonable though! You get a lot of product for a small price and a little goes a long way. This tube will likely last me months and I use this everyday. Overall this is a great option for makeup removal that eliminates the need for makeup wipes which aren’t great for the environment. I will continue to use and repurchase this because it works great and fits nicely into my skincare routine.",Oat Cleansing Balm,The INKEY List,Positive,
1329,1,2023-03-14,I DO NOT LIKE THIS AT ALL. And I’m so sadden to say this but it is the truth. I was in Sephora a few weeks ago and I was so excited to learn about Inkey List because I know someone who has seen great results with this brand and when I saw their skin I asked them what is their routine/products they use. So I went to Sephora and was trying to figure out which product(s) to try from Inkey List first. WELL I got the oat cleanser complimentary from Influenster & I was SO HAPPY/Excited to try it.  Immediately when I squeezed it out the tube oil came out. The smell isn’t Good. It is a weird bland smell. And as soon as I put it on my face immediately I said oh no this isn’t good. It felt like Vaseline all over my face that wouldn’t rinse off no matter how many times I tried to rinse it off. It didn’t feel clean. I’m so sad to have to write a review saying I don’t like it but I have to be honest. But I definitely will try other Inkey List products. But this is just a NO for me. But I’m very glad I got to try it. :),Oat Cleansing Balm,The INKEY List,Positive,

1331,5,2023-03-13,"I love this cleanser. It’s one of the few I’ve ever tried that makes me want to repurchase use it consistently. I get a ton of samples and buy skincare when it goes on sale to try so I don’t have a ton of constants in my routine. This is AMAZING though. It’s rich and thick like a cleansing balm, It smells a little strange but not bad. It smells like natural oatmeal and honey- it’s doesn’t have fragrance added which I appreciate.  It is sort of moisturizing too which is awesome. It might be a bit too rich to use every single day but I’ll ABSOLUTELY be repurchasing this. If you have dry skin or live in a dry climate I’d highly recommend trying this out. The price point is also awesome. I would happily pay double for this product. I’ve never tried anything from Inkey list before this but I’m absolutely going to be looking into it and trying more. This is also awesome to wash makeup sponges with.

That being said, it does remove make up really well and as I’ve gotten older (I’ll be 30 this year) I’ve noticed my skin changing, becoming more sensitive and dry, whereas a few years ago my skin was normal and not sensitive at all and this product does not break me out.

It does its job as a daily cleanser, rinses off well without feeling tacky, melts off makeup (waterproof mascaras and eyeliners will benefit from a second wash).

My skin type is a little bit oily so I only use this product as a sunscreen remover and use other cleanser to do clean the residue. Overall it is a good light makeup/sunscreen cleanser to me.,Oat Cleansing Balm,The INKEY List,Positive,

1381,1,2023-03-08,"I did NOT like this product. It left a waxy type of residue on my face after using it, and the texture was not something I’m a fan of.

1383,2,2023-03-08,"Got this free to review from influenster and The Inkey List, I was excited to try this out. Sadly disappointed, first it had an interesting smell that I can only describe as petroleum jelly, tried it for a few days. I would remove my make up first and then applied and left for the recommended 10 min. My skin would feel clean but stripped and dry. And once I would apply my moisturizer it would burn, so I can’t imagine doing the “treat” step which describes as “exfoliate” when my skin already burns without doing that. It’s a no for me.",Oat Cleansing Balm,The INKEY List,Positive,
1384,5,2023-03-08,"As someone who is constantly trying new skincare products, I was eager to try out this product and see how it worked for my skin. One of the things I love about this cleansing balm is how gentle it is on my skin. Even though it effectively removes all my makeup and impurities, it does not leave my skin feeling stripped or dry. In fact, my skin feels hydrated and plump after using this product.The packaging of this product is simple yet elegant, with a white jar that has a black screw-on lid. The product itself is a thick balm that melts into an oil when it comes into contact with the skin. It has a very faint scent, which is a plus for those who are sensitive to fragrances.One of the things I love about this cleansing balm is how gentle it is on my skin. Even though it effectively removes all my makeup and impurities, it does not leave my skin feeling stripped or dry. In fact, my skin feels hydrated and plump after using this product.Another great thing about this cleansing balm is its key ingredient: oat kernel oil. Oat kernel oil is known for its soothing and moisturizing properties, which makes it perfect for those with sensitive or dry skin. I also appreciate that this product is vegan and cruelty-free, as it aligns with my values and beliefs.Overall, I highly recommend The INKEY List Oat Cleansing Balm to anyone looking for a gentle and effective cleansing balm that leaves the skin feeling nourished and hydrated. It is a great addition to any skincare routine, and I will definitely be repurchasing it in the future.",Oat Cleansing Balm,The INKEY List,Positive,
1385,1,2023-03-08,This felt like rubbing beeswax on my face. It would not spread and did not clean anything off my face.

Definitely a must try!,Oat Cleansing Balm,The INKEY List,Positive,
1393,3,2023-03-07,"For the price and the amount you get, this product is fairly good! It removes most makeup as a first cleanse, doesn’t strip my sensitive and dry skin, and it doesn’t have a scent. I did notice that it didn’t completely take my mascara off, though. However, as long as you double cleanse, this will work just fine. I used micellar water after to see if there was any makeup leftover.",Oat Cleansing Balm,The INKEY List,Positive,
1394,2,2023-03-07,"Did not like it, it was rough on my face, I have to scrub a little hard to try taking off my makeup.

1396,3,2023-03-07,This cleansing balm works amazing to get your face clean. The only downside is it says to leave on your face for 10 minutes.

1402,1,2023-03-07,"It doesn’t emulsify like a regular cleansing balm, leaving behind an oily film when rinsed off. I tried a couple different ways of using it, including what the directions say but I get the same result. Also, the product separates so bad, when I go to squeeze it out all I get is oil and then finally some of the thicker part starts to come out. But then you just have a bunch of oil in your hands which is not what I want from a cleansing balm. This happens even when I try to shake it up. It doesn’t even remove my makeup all that well. Overall, there’s much better cleansing balms out there that don’t leave you feeling greasy",Oat Cleansing Balm,The INKEY List,Negative,3.0

I have acne and combo to oily skin and I use to be so afraid of putting anything like this on my skin and honestly it’s made such a positive impact on my skin!

1407,5,2023-03-06,"I really like this product in the cooler, dryer months. I do think I will alternate this cleanser on different days, depending on whether I have makeup to remove, etc. I will say that it’s incredibly moisturizing for a cleanser. I touched my skin after cleansing, before applying moisturizer, and did a double take. It felt like I had already applied a moisturizer to my skin!The balm itself is incredibly rich, with a texture unlike any other cleanser I have tried.",Oat Cleansing Balm,The INKEY List,Positive,
1408,3,2023-03-06,Very thick and greasy cleanser. It didn’t take my mascara off. I was left with racoon eyes. I can say my skin is much softer and smoother after a week of use. I probably wouldn’t but this cleanser again.,Oat Cleansing Balm,The INKEY List,Negative,1.0

I wanted to give it another try and looked at reviews, and tried using it without water, and rinsing it off with water, same issue. I think this is a good product to take off costume make up, as it did a great job taking off all my makeup and it is gentle on your skin, however I hate the feeling of my face feeling greasy. I prefer deep cleaning facial cleaners.I can see this leaving your face soft if you don’t rinse it off with a second cleaner, however I don’t believe this is the right cleaner for me.Warning: I would not encourage anyone to use this product around their eyes if they have eyelash extensions.",Oat Cleansing Balm,The INKEY List,Positive,

I expected a balm, lightweight, milky cleanser. The opposite is the case: this is a thick, creamy, hardgellike little crunchy but than melting cleanser!If you overcome this hurdle - YOU WILL LOVE IT! The trick is in my opinion to only damp the face. Tha smallest amount is enough to take of normal day Make-up whilst rubbing it all over your face.

1457,5,2023-03-03,"I have never used a cleansing balm before so I wasn’t sure what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised! The texture of the balm when you squeeze it out is thick, once you rub it in your hands it melts into a liquid and becomes a lathee when you apply it to your wet face and neck. My face felt so clean after using this product, there is no scent and there was no irritation. This did not leave my skin feeling dry either. I would definitely recommend this product.",Oat Cleansing Balm,The INKEY List,Positive,
1458,5,2023-03-03,"I adore this cleanser, but I do admit it won’t be for everyone. This is a thick, thick balm. It’s probably unlike any other cleansing balm you may have used. I liken the consistency to Vaseline. However, it spreads really easily and is super smooth. No scent. Cleans my face super well, removes makeup, etc. My face feels nice and soft afterwards and also moisturized which is nice for cleanser. I will definitely be adding this into my daily routine.",Oat Cleansing Balm,The INKEY List,Positive,
1459,5,2023-03-03,"I’ve tried several balm make up removers and I’ve got to say this has the best packaging so far. Everyone loses the little spatula/spoon balms come with and you end up using fingers. With this product you just easily squeeze out whatever amount you need. As for the texture, etc - it is a little greasy but nothing to worry about. It Makes your face feel even more moisturized.",Oat Cleansing Balm,The INKEY List,Positive,
1460,5,2023-03-03,"I received this product from Influenster to try and I really like it. Goes on smooth, cleans well, and doesn’t dry my skin out. I tend to have sensitive skin and it isn’t irritating. No weird smells which is also a plus with me.",Oat Cleansing Balm,The INKEY List,Positive,
1461,3,2023-03-03,"This is an ok cleansing balm, but not my favorite. It’s a bit too thick and greasy for my liking, which tends to clog my pores and cause breakouts. I do like how gentle it is, but it is not the best at actually cleansing my face",Oat Cleansing Balm,The INKEY List,Positive,

The INKEY List is already a staple in my skin care routine, and I have to say that this is another one of those products to add from them. At first I was like “oof. I don’t like this.“ But, then, I added a little more water and it foamed up and I immediately ate my words. I’ve used it for a couple of days now and my skin feels much softer and even. Since I have sensitive skin, I usually dry out with cleansers, but this does the complete opposite. There are no harsh chemicals, no weird perfume-y smells, just an all around good product.",Oat Cleansing Balm,The INKEY List,Positive,

1465,4,2023-03-03,"So full transparency, I did receive this product for free from Influenster in exchange for my review. BUT I didn’t expect to be THIS impressed with the product. Now to be fair, I’ve only used it for one day and that’s why I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5. The true tell will be how my skin reacts after consistent use. But I can say that after my first use, my skin feels clean and extremely moisturized. I did leave it on for 10 minutes as well because my skin has been dry lately with the constant change in weather (and pregnancy hormones…yay) but for reference, I don’t have sensitive skin. I’m pretty stoked on this cleanser, especially given the price and how long it’ll last me with how rich the formula is.

1485,3,2023-03-01,"I received this product for free from Influenster in exchange for an unfiltered and honest review. So here it goes!I love clean beauty products and I love knowing what ingredients are going on my skin. The packaging of this product is fairly simple. FYI: everything about this product is recyclable (package, bottle, and cap). The product is VERY emollient and thick consistent with Bag Balm. The scent is neutral. When attempting to squeeze the product out, I had an extremely difficult time (maybe still frozen from the northeast cold), but when I did get it out, it went on relatively smoothly. When mixed with water, it instantly turns into a more creamy texture.Now to breakdown this product’s ingredient list. Most of the ingredients found in this product are used to stabilize it. For those with sensitive or dry skin, be aware that there seems to be some alcohol in this. Cetearyl Alcohol is an emulsifier and stabilizer for this balm. It is not considered a traditional alcohol that are known for drying the skin. Unfortunately, when you move further down the ingredient list, there are phenoxyethanol and benzoyl alcohol which are used as preservatives. Overall, while this cleansing balm was very emollient and can take your make-up off well, the product may not be as clean as it has been marketed as.",Oat Cleansing Balm,The INKEY List,Positive,

I used it the second time to try to remove some eye makeup and it felt more like I was smearing it around.

I bought it because you can’t beat the price/oz--- it’s a huge bottle, but I don’t like it very much. It tends to separate in the bottle, which makes it hard to use. After a few months of use the top of the bottle is slimy because somehow the product drips out even though I try to close it well. If I store it without the top down then it separates even more. I use this as a first cleanse, but I can’t imagine using it alone since there is always a film after use even after rinsing.",Mini Oat Cleansing Balm,The INKEY List,Positive,

1547,4,2023-03-16,This product is thick! Definitely comes out as a balm and rubbing it between your palms becomes more of a cleansing oil. It will help remove your makeup and impurities while hydrating and pre-cleansing the skin. I recommend using another cleanser afterwards. But as a pre-cleanser you definitely can tell it adds hydration. I enjoyed it more than I thought I would because it does remove my make up and rinse is cleared with my second cleansing. I’m 38 and find that a little extra hydration goes along way for me these days. If you’re looking for a way to keep your skin hydrated without a ton of lotions  this is a great option. I also love that it doesn’t have any intense fragrance.,Mini Oat Cleansing Balm,The INKEY List,Positive,

1564,4,2023-03-14,"Let me start off by saying I LOVE this product, but I could see how it wouldn’t be for everyone.This is a cleansing balm meant to remove makeup and leaving the skin feeling soft, but this is definitely not a one and done kind of product. I have to double cleanse when I use this- meaning I use this to remove makeup and then then go in with a different cleanser to clean my skin. I don’t mind double cleansing as it’s the best way to get your skin completely clean regardless of if you’re using this product or not, but some people won’t like the extra step. As far as other balms I’ve used, this is one of the best. It gets oily, but not run all over your hand oily and it does an INCREDIBLE job at breaking down makeup, including waterproof mascara. However I gave this 4 stars as the packaging could be improved. I liked the idea of a squeeze tube because it is more hygienic than dipping your hand a jar and risking contamination. This balm however is too thick for a squeeze tube and it was extremely hard to get out. I worry that as I get lower on product in the squeeze tube it will be nearly impossible to get any out. The price is very reasonable though! You get a lot of product for a small price and a little goes a long way. This tube will likely last me months and I use this everyday. Overall this is a great option for makeup removal that eliminates the need for makeup wipes which aren’t great for the environment. I will continue to use and repurchase this because it works great and fits nicely into my skincare routine.",Mini Oat Cleansing Balm,The INKEY List,Positive,
1565,1,2023-03-14,I DO NOT LIKE THIS AT ALL. And I’m so sadden to say this but it is the truth. I was in Sephora a few weeks ago and I was so excited to learn about Inkey List because I know someone who has seen great results with this brand and when I saw their skin I asked them what is their routine/products they use. So I went to Sephora and was trying to figure out which product(s) to try from Inkey List first. WELL I got the oat cleanser complimentary from Influenster & I was SO HAPPY/Excited to try it.  Immediately when I squeezed it out the tube oil came out. The smell isn’t Good. It is a weird bland smell. And as soon as I put it on my face immediately I said oh no this isn’t good. It felt like Vaseline all over my face that wouldn’t rinse off no matter how many times I tried to rinse it off. It didn’t feel clean. I’m so sad to have to write a review saying I don’t like it but I have to be honest. But I definitely will try other Inkey List products. But this is just a NO for me. But I’m very glad I got to try it. :),Mini Oat Cleansing Balm,The INKEY List,Positive,

1567,5,2023-03-13,"I love this cleanser. It’s one of the few I’ve ever tried that makes me want to repurchase use it consistently. I get a ton of samples and buy skincare when it goes on sale to try so I don’t have a ton of constants in my routine. This is AMAZING though. It’s rich and thick like a cleansing balm, It smells a little strange but not bad. It smells like natural oatmeal and honey- it’s doesn’t have fragrance added which I appreciate.  It is sort of moisturizing too which is awesome. It might be a bit too rich to use every single day but I’ll ABSOLUTELY be repurchasing this. If you have dry skin or live in a dry climate I’d highly recommend trying this out. The price point is also awesome. I would happily pay double for this product. I’ve never tried anything from Inkey list before this but I’m absolutely going to be looking into it and trying more. This is also awesome to wash makeup sponges with.

I’m unsure if that is the intended way to use it, but that was the best use for me personally. That being said, it does remove make up really well and as I’ve gotten older (I’ll be 30 this year) I’ve noticed my skin changing, becoming more sensitive and dry, whereas a few years ago my skin was normal and not sensitive at all and this product does not break me out. Which for me is also another win. And you can’t beat the price either. I love clean products and I think I’m going to continue with this as a staple in my routine as a makeup remover.

It does its job as a daily cleanser, rinses off well without feeling tacky, melts off makeup (waterproof mascaras and eyeliners will benefit from a second wash).

1614,4,2023-03-09,I received this product in my VoxBox for review. The texture of this product is very thick and it is hard to squeeze the bottle. My skin type is a little bit oily so I only use this product as a sunscreen remover and use other cleanser to do clean the residue.

1619,2,2023-03-08,"Got this free to review from influenster and The Inkey List, I was excited to try this out. Sadly disappointed, first it had an interesting smell that I can only describe as petroleum jelly, tried it for a few days. I would remove my make up first and then applied and left for the recommended 10 min. My skin would feel clean but stripped and dry. And once I would apply my moisturizer it would burn, so I can’t imagine doing the “treat” step which describes as “exfoliate” when my skin already burns without doing that. It’s a no for me.",Mini Oat Cleansing Balm,The INKEY List,Positive,
1620,5,2023-03-08,"As someone who is constantly trying new skincare products, I was eager to try out this product and see how it worked for my skin. One of the things I love about this cleansing balm is how gentle it is on my skin. Even though it effectively removes all my makeup and impurities, it does not leave my skin feeling stripped or dry. In fact, my skin feels hydrated and plump after using this product.The packaging of this product is simple yet elegant, with a white jar that has a black screw-on lid. The product itself is a thick balm that melts into an oil when it comes into contact with the skin. It has a very faint scent, which is a plus for those who are sensitive to fragrances.One of the things I love about this cleansing balm is how gentle it is on my skin. Even though it effectively removes all my makeup and impurities, it does not leave my skin feeling stripped or dry. In fact, my skin feels hydrated and plump after using this product.Another great thing about this cleansing balm is its key ingredient: oat kernel oil. Oat kernel oil is known for its soothing and moisturizing properties, which makes it perfect for those with sensitive or dry skin. I also appreciate that this product is vegan and cruelty-free, as it aligns with my values and beliefs.Overall, I highly recommend The INKEY List Oat Cleansing Balm to anyone looking for a gentle and effective cleansing balm that leaves the skin feeling nourished and hydrated. It is a great addition to any skincare routine, and I will definitely be repurchasing it in the future.",Mini Oat Cleansing Balm,The INKEY List,Positive,

I did notice that it didn’t completely take my mascara off, though. However, as long as you double cleanse, this will work just fine. I used micellar water after to see if there was any makeup leftover.",Mini Oat Cleansing Balm,The INKEY List,Positive,

1632,3,2023-03-07,This cleansing balm works amazing to get your face clean. The only downside is it says to leave on your face for 10 minutes.

1638,1,2023-03-07,"It doesn’t emulsify like a regular cleansing balm, leaving behind an oily film when rinsed off. I tried a couple different ways of using it, including what the directions say but I get the same result. Also, the product separates so bad, when I go to squeeze it out all I get is oil and then finally some of the thicker part starts to come out. But then you just have a bunch of oil in your hands which is not what I want from a cleansing balm. This happens even when I try to shake it up. It doesn’t even remove my makeup all that well.

I do think I will alternate this cleanser on different days, depending on whether I have makeup to remove, etc. I will say that it’s incredibly moisturizing for a cleanser.

I think this is a good product to take off costume make up, as it did a great job taking off all my makeup and it is gentle on your skin, however I hate the feeling of my face feeling greasy. I prefer deep cleaning facial cleaners.I can see this leaving your face soft if you don’t rinse it off with a second cleaner, however I don’t believe this is the right cleaner for me.Warning: I would not encourage anyone to use this product around their eyes if they have eyelash extensions.",Mini Oat Cleansing Balm,The INKEY List,Positive,

The trick is in my opinion to only damp the face. Tha smallest amount is enough to take of normal day Make-up whilst rubbing it all over your face.

1691,5,2023-03-03,I really like this balm. It’s thick but it softens quickly and is very effective at removing makeup and daily grime. I always use it before washing my face. It doesn’t have an overwhelming odor which I love. The tube is huge and comes with so much product so you’re definitely getting a good value. I haven’t noticed any issues with my skin since I began using it. I definitely would recommend this.,Mini Oat Cleansing Balm,The INKEY List,Positive,

1693,5,2023-03-03,"I have never used a cleansing balm before so I wasn’t sure what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised! The texture of the balm when you squeeze it out is thick, once you rub it in your hands it melts into a liquid and becomes a lathee when you apply it to your wet face and neck. My face felt so clean after using this product, there is no scent and there was no irritation. This did not leave my skin feeling dry either. I would definitely recommend this product.",Mini Oat Cleansing Balm,The INKEY List,Positive,
1694,5,2023-03-03,"I adore this cleanser, but I do admit it won’t be for everyone. This is a thick, thick balm. It’s probably unlike any other cleansing balm you may have used. I liken the consistency to Vaseline. However, it spreads really easily and is super smooth. No scent. Cleans my face super well, removes makeup, etc. My face feels nice and soft afterwards and also moisturized which is nice for cleanser. I will definitely be adding this into my daily routine.",Mini Oat Cleansing Balm,The INKEY List,Positive,

The INKEY List is already a staple in my skin care routine, and I have to say that this is another one of those products to add from them. At first I was like “oof. I don’t like this.“ But, then, I added a little more water and it foamed up and I immediately ate my words. I’ve used it for a couple of days now and my skin feels much softer and even. Since I have sensitive skin, I usually dry out with cleansers, but this does the complete opposite.

Now to be fair, I’ve only used it for one day and that’s why I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5. The true tell will be how my skin reacts after consistent use. But I can say that after my first use, my skin feels clean and extremely moisturized. I did leave it on for 10 minutes as well because my skin has been dry lately with the constant change in weather (and pregnancy hormones…yay) but for reference, I don’t have sensitive skin.

1721,3,2023-03-01,"I received this product for free from Influenster in exchange for an unfiltered and honest review. So here it goes!I love clean beauty products and I love knowing what ingredients are going on my skin. The packaging of this product is fairly simple. FYI: everything about this product is recyclable (package, bottle, and cap). The product is VERY emollient and thick consistent with Bag Balm. The scent is neutral. When attempting to squeeze the product out, I had an extremely difficult time (maybe still frozen from the northeast cold), but when I did get it out, it went on relatively smoothly. When mixed with water, it instantly turns into a more creamy texture.Now to breakdown this product’s ingredient list. Most of the ingredients found in this product are used to stabilize it. For those with sensitive or dry skin, be aware that there seems to be some alcohol in this. Cetearyl Alcohol is an emulsifier and stabilizer for this balm. It is not considered a traditional alcohol that are known for drying the skin. Unfortunately, when you move further down the ingredient list, there are phenoxyethanol and benzoyl alcohol which are used as preservatives. Overall, while this cleansing balm was very emollient and can take your make-up off well, the product may not be as clean as it has been marketed as.",Mini Oat Cleansing Balm,The INKEY List,Positive,

I get compliments on how great my skin looks all the time for my age, especially just turning 40 years old. After 7 days of trialing both products, I am sadden to say that I couldn’t really see a difference in my skin.  I know the serum is suppose to help with fine lines and wrinkles and texture but I have a solid skincare routine that is catered to it already and cheaper than how much the serum and eye lift costs. I also read that some people felt the double serum seemed a little oily but it was the perfect consistency for my combo skin that leans more dry.

1804,3,2023-03-15,"I bought this product after a very insistent recommendation by a Sephora associate. It’s good, but definitely not for me (mainly, because I’m in my 20s, and this felt like it was formulated for more mature skin, or at least for different needs than mine).It was my first time using a dual serum, and though I was initially worried about the oil causing breakouts, it didn’t. My skin was noticeably smoother, and I liked the mild hydration, but for the price point, it just was not worth it. The feel is very silky, which I liked, but the strong perfume smell was very unpleasant. Compared to other serums I’ve used that also had an “anti-aging” claim, I felt this one was not nearly as hydrating or as plumping, though I do feel it gave a good, natural smoothness to skin, that was less shiny. Overall, definitely some strong pros, but the perfume is a major con for me, as is the price. It’s a product that I see can be good for some, but I regret being encouraged to strongly to buy for myself, and would not repurchase, or even encourage others to buy unless this is really what they’re looking for.",Double Serum Firming & Smoothing Anti-Aging Concentrate,Clarins,Positive,

I like the consistency. It reminds me of the Tatcha water cream. I used to love the tatcha, but for the price, I felt like I would run out so fast, and I also felt like after it absorbed into the skin, it was dry again like the hydration didn’t stay. So I bought this and was very pleased. It is super hydrating, doesn’t have much of an odor, if any, and it leaves me feeling moisturized, but not greasy, all day. I have combo skin, so I worry about becoming super greasy in some areas while remaining dry in others, but in my experience, this works well with both the oily and dry patches in my skin. For reference, I use aveeno foaming face wash with an electronic silicone brush, and then I use the isles of paradise tanning drops mixed in with this serum. Sometimes if my skin really needs a drink, I will use my heavier creams at night, but this usually does the trick as my everyday moisturizer/ hydration serum. (If I don’t need a full heavy cream, but need a little extra umph, I will use aveeno daily moisturizer and combine. This product plays well with others is what I am trying to say (even if it’s not DE brand). The only reason I am not rating it 4 stars is because I don’t know if it works for everyone, and it is a little pricey.

I am someone who is always skeptical when someone claims a product had immediate results,  but I was shocked to find this product really did have immediate results. Not going to erase the damage overnight but it is definitely night and day. I love the pump to control how much I use and make sure it lasts a long time. It’s a little pricey, but I can definitely see the value. I love peptide moisturizers and tried the e Ole Henriksen strength train before using the Youth to the People Future cream, until now.

This is great if you have good skin to begin with- Super long lasting hydration and wears great under make up. However, I would recommend skipping this if your skin is going through a rough patch.

That said, for the price, I expect a *really* good barrier cream, and (IMO) this isn’t it as it larely sinks in, even using the serum first. It’s a moisturizer and maybe it’s adding some important lipids back into my skin barrier, but the effect on my skin didn’t provide a visible improvement. At times over the winter, I’ve even noticed some skin flaking. I previously used Ceramidin cream and noticed the marked difference immediately with a switch back -- plumper skin and an appreciable barrier layer.

For what it’s worth, my mom (who also has dry skin) found it didn’t help her either. Also, I found the packaging to be kinda gross.

I always use a product until it’s done (unless I have a bad reaction to it) because I don’t want to waste money. This cleaner has the appearance and consistency of snot.

This did absolutely nothing. The beads did not exfoliate or scrub. They mostly just rolled around my face and the cleanser doesn’t feel like it cleans my skin like the Rice Wash does and it shows because when I tone after using Dermalogica or Philosophy, the pad looks clean. After using Tatcha’s exfoliating cleanser, my pad was left looking like my skin still had residue from makeup when I toned my skin.

2052,4,2023-03-15,"It’s true that despite what some claims say, the pilling isn’t dead skin but the product reacting the oils on your skin. Personally, this is not a downside, I just wish it was more honest in the description/sales pitch I got from an Sephora associate. After all, this is primarily a chemical, not physical exfoliant (though it feels a bit like one). In this sense, it can be a good transition product for people who are used to physical exfoliants but want to transition to using AHAs/BHAs, while still having a scrub experience. If you apply to clean, VERY dry skin, it works a lot better, and it did drastically reduce the dry skin I would have on my face over time. My pores were less obvious, and I liked using it on days before going out, so that makeup would apply more smoothly. The biggest downside in my experience was that it’s pretty intense, and I had to decrease my usage by a lot because it was drying out my skin too much (and ironically creating dry skin patches). I still like it and use it, and have even repurchased it, but if you have sensitive skin be careful because it can be too harsh or drying. Because it’s hard to use as often, I don’t see as many results anymore. However, in warmer/more humid seasons it’s a great, fun part of my routine.I definitely recommend to others, when used in moderation, if you want the fun of a physical scrub in chemical exfoliation, and if you’re not put off by the texture (pilling).

I strictly use the drops as a primer (although these are great for your no-makeup days). In order for your makeup to NOT look cakey, you must use a water based / silicone free primer. The few drops are water-based. I checked the ingredients and there’s no silicones in it. I know this because I made the terrible mistake of using a silicone-based foundation on top of the drops and my makeup looked so cakey and gross. But when I used a water-based foundation on top of the drops, my makeup looked so natural and beautiful. All primer/foundation combos are not created equally.

2132,5,2023-03-17,"This is an interesting one. I like to use it as a product to prep my skin for makeup more than I rely on it for my skincare needs. It’s amazing to see how something formulated without mica or glitter imparts that ’glow’. It’s a lightweight, non-greasy serum that stays tacky for a few minutes but then eventually sets in. The serum is hydrating and moisturizing and looks dewy, not greasy. I use a light tinted moisturizer on top of this serum. Anything medium to full coverage defeats the purpose. It does not pill on me but the key is to wait till the product sinks/sets in before layering anything else. Smells refreshingly good. It’s more of a primer with skin benefiting ingredients more than actual skincare if that makes sense.",Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Dew Drops,Glow Recipe,Positive,

It does have a particular smell, but I believe it’s because it’s fragrance free, so I’m happy with it.

2360,5,2023-03-13,"I typically use (and have been happy) with cerave and cetaphil moisturizers at night, but they have never played very well with my makeup; I have tried various moisturizers for daytime and this was just “next” on my list to try. Yes, it smells like an aged soft cheese however, the smell dissipates quickly. I cannot smell it once I have blended the moisturizer completely into my skin. Initially I was very very nervous, my skin ATE this up. For about a week it seemed like my skin was a just sucking it up and I was watching a very quick demise of a very expensive product. I was not happy, but after several days my skin sort of balanced and I had to use a bit less. It was an interesting development; the temperature here has been consistently cold with no humidity to speak of, so I know my skin is the affecting variable. I don’t know yet if it is worth the money, but it plays nice with my expensive layering products and my skin seems to like it. While it is not as occlusive as I like for my night moisturizer, I will continue to use it for a good makeup base; it leaves my skin just slightly tacky enough to make my tinted moisturizer glide over the top perfectly.",Squalane + Omega Repair Deep Hydration Moisturizer,Biossance,Positive,

2364,4,2023-03-09,"My winter and night time go to moisturizer. I find it is usually too heavy for summer, but as I live in the pacific northwest it works great as a night time moisturizer the rest of the year. I also use it during the day in winter if I am especially dry, however I only do so on no make up days as it doesn’t work the best under make up imo. This is totally a night cream though despite it not specifying so, so I honestly don’t expect it to look great under make up. I find it works best if you have some kind of water based serum underneath that you let dry first, as the thick formula of the moisturizer helps lock in the hydration. It does a good job on it’s own don’t get me wrong, but if you pair it with a nice serum the combo effect is even better. Absolutely love that there is a value size now. I share my skin care with my partner and the value size lasted us almost all winter.",Squalane + Omega Repair Deep Hydration Moisturizer,Biossance,Positive,

I don’t know if it’ll work so well in the summer months, it may be too heavy, but for winter it’s a-m-a-z-i-n-g! It somehow feels perfectly light, rich, and nourishing at the same time. A little goes a long way. My skin is just so plump and balanced after using this! It doesn’t leave me looking or feeling greasy or shiny at all. It actually almost makes my skin look matte, but without any of the dullness or dryness.I don’t remember now if there was any fragrance in the ingredients list, but I don’t notice a scent one way or the other.

I went through probably 10 different moisturizers;  some that are just popular online, and some known to be effective for helping the concerns that I had.  This was the only one that checked all my boxes.  It helped my redness, calmed the dryness, and even aided in clearing up my acne (along with salicylic acid).  As mentioned in nearly every review, no, it doesn’t smell great.  It isn’t heavily fragranced like many popular moisturizers are, and one of the things in it likely produces the odd smell.  For some, this is an automatic deal breaker.  If you’re like me though, sensitive to fragrance and don’t mind the odd smell (which is only present during application), this is a great moisturizer.",Squalane + Omega Repair Deep Hydration Moisturizer,Biossance,Positive,

It didn’t look bad - but it didn’t look $50 impactful either.- Washes off after use (I did know this info prior to purchase but I had to dig to find it)- I struggle to understand the place for the bronzing portion of this product. The suggestion is to add it to your skincare products, not your makeup, so presumably, it’s for no/light makeup days, but if I was planning to go outside I’d likely still be adding something with SPF overtop which dulls the effect further.ConclusionWhilst the skincare effects were good but the bronzing wasn’t impactful or useful enough to justify the price tag - for me at least.",D-Bronzi Anti-Pollution Bronzing Drops with Peptides,Drunk Elephant,Positive,

2569,5,2023-03-01,So ive had this product for about a month or so and I ADORE it. I have sensitive and dry skin so I was scared that I was gonna break out but I didnt (thank god). At first I wasnt that big of a fan and I thought it looked cakey and makeupy and too tan. and im pale and ive never used this type of tan product before. If you dont want the full effect I HIGHLY recommend you use this as a bronzer. Using at a bronzer was a great idea since I didnt want it all over my face and it added the bronze sun kissed look that blended out really well. Once I started mixing this with sunscreen or moistrizer I liked it alot and have been using it since. I think if you are thinking about it buy and see how it goes! but some tips i recommend if you are weary is to first apply it as a bronzer or mix it with a thick moisturizer or regular sunscreen!,D-Bronzi Anti-Pollution Bronzing Drops with Peptides,Drunk Elephant,Positive,

What I will say is that I think a lot of people were expecting a lot more out of this product. You have to remember, that this product is meant to be mixed with moisturizer, so you are essentially creating a tinted moisturizer, the only difference is that you can change the level of intensity. It makes me look noticeably tanner. I have a friend with a much darker complexion than me with olive tones, and it also looks great on her. I tend to use this, with my moisturizer, and then I will spot conceal and ’highlight’ the areas of my face that would traditionally be lighter when doing my makeup normally (T-zone, chin, and under the eyes above the cheekbones). Then I put on freckles, do my eyebrows and add setting spray. It looks super natural and gives me the ’clean girl’ aesthetic or the ’no makeup makeup look’.

2618,5,2023-03-06,"So let me start off by saying this is the first hyaluronic, AHA/BHA product I’ve used, so I don’t have anything to compare it to.I’ve been eyeballing this for sometime but the price is too steep for me to buy and not like. Sephora luckily listed this as a sample to try in their offer section, so I jumped on this immediately. After 1 use I immediately felt my face smooth and free of any tiny bumps I felt! After 2 or 3 uses (used 2x in a week) my husband said you look like you’re glowing and your face looks even. Now this could be a change in my diet, but I HIGHLY doubt it due to the fact I’ve done this diet before with no facial improvements. I’m honestly sold and will definitely buy after the 7-day samples (which I’m able to cut in half due to the consistency where I don’t have to use a lot… plus).Reasons why I love this:1. Immediate change in facial texture after one use the next day. Smoother skinAfter 2-3 uses: 2. Brighter skin3. Evening skin tone (I’ve had some discoloration in my skin which started in 2020. The sides of my face was darker than the center for some reason. This evened out my skin tone 90%). This alone is why I’m going to rebuy4. Plumper looking face (my husband noticed this)5. A little goes a long way. Love the consistency 6. Maybe very slight tingling the first or second use, but it did not burn. My skin is also not sensitive though. I also don’t use this dailyI absolutely LOVE Farmacy. I’ve tried 5 products so far, and not 1 has let me down!

I bought tons of different hydrating moisturizers and toners but nothing calmed my skin down and hydrated it like this Laneige one did. I use it in the AM & PM, before my moisturizer. It took one use for my skin to stop feeling itchy (for hours before I had to reapply) and about a week for me to see major results in all my issues. Now my skin is hydrated and has no issues!

I’ve dealt with hyperpigmentation for years and I have quite reactive skin so I’m always intrigued by products that can serve multiple purposes without irritating my skin. The texture of this serum is so lovely and light. Unlike other products I’ve tried, this did not sit on top of my skin or leave a slippery residue. It absorbed quickly and was easy to layer with other products. The citrus scent is light and disappeared quickly. While I haven’t noticed a significant reduction in my hyperpigmentation so far, I know my skin takes time to adapt to new products and I’m confident that I’ll see a difference as I keep using it.

After just a couple of uses I noticed that my skin felt a lot more supple and hydrated. With continued use I noticed a healthy glow and brightness and some of my textural irregularities have improved. The pump applicator is great so you don’t squeeze out too much at once, and the product itself is more of a liquidy white cream. The scent is mild and pleasantly citrusy.

2725,3,2023-03-15,"This product was received complimentary from Influenster and Sunday Riley in exchange for my honest review: I have mixed feelings about CEO serum. On one hand it is the only vitamin C cream I have used that didn’t cause me to break out and it doesn’t oxidize in my pores and cause blackheads. On the other hand it is quite pricey, not overly moisturizing and I didn’t notice any brightening effects in the 3 weeks I have been using it consistently. It is a nice lightweight, non-greasy formula so maybe I will enjoy it more in the summer when my skin tends to be more oily but for the dry winter months it seems an extra, unnecessary step that isn’t doing a whole lot for my skin. The scent is nice and light, citrus plus maybe vanilla (like a creamsicle scent). My skin can be sensitive to harsh ingredients and perfumes but and I didn’t notice any irritation with this serum. Overall I am happy with the serum but it’s hard to complain when the product was free.

The bottle is nice and heavy and comes with a pump. I’ve been using the serum for a little over 3 weeks. It has a serum lotion like consistency. It’s smooth light and not sticky. I’ve been using 2 pumps so I can apply it on my face, neck and chest. There is a faint scent of citrus that quickly disappears upon application.In the short time I’ve been using it I’ve seen a healthy glow to my skin. Fine lines are less pronounced and my skin is plumper. With longer use I hope to see a couple tiny dark spots lighten up or disappear over time. Vitamin C serums have been my go to so having tried too many to count I have high expectations with every new one I try. This one is on the level so far. Only time will tell if it gets any better. I do recommend Sunday Riley CEO Vitamin C Serum. 4 stars for the results I have seen thus far. If it fades my dark spots it will definitely give it a 5 star review from me. I can’t wait to try more Sunday Riley skincare. @SundayRiley @Influenster #CEOSerumVoxBox #SundayRiley #CEOSerum #GlowLikeACEO",C.E.O. 15% Vitamin C Brightening Serum,Sunday Riley,Positive,

However, I don’t know if it did anything to brighter or even out my skin tone where I have hyperpigmentation so I can’t justify it for the price.  Maybe I would need to use it longer/more consistently to see those results",C.E.O. 15% Vitamin C Brightening Serum,Sunday Riley,Positive,

It also doesn’t seem to interfere with my sunscreen or any makeup I put on after as there’s no pilling. So far there’s no off-putting scent, which is a huge plus as I’ve found over time some Vitamin C’s go back quickly and have a weird scent.",C.E.O. 15% Vitamin C Brightening Serum,Sunday Riley,Positive,

2755,4,2023-03-13,I have been using this serum daily for a few weeks and found it has made my skin feel soft after each use. The cream was a little thicker than I was expecting but after several uses I got used to the consistency. The citrus scent is light and refreshing which is a nice addition to my skincare routine.

2761,5,2023-03-13,"I was sent the Sunday Riley C.E.O. Vitamin C serum by influenster and Sunday Riley for an honest review and here it is: I’m not a big fan of vitamin C serums. I find they tend to go off quick and I don’t see much results. So I was extremely thorough with this one given its price point. I started with one pump in the morning and built up to two. My skin is incredibly stubborn when it comes to dark spots and I’ve only seen substantial results with retinol. Until now. I don’t want to be dramatic but my skin loves this stuff! I’ve noticed an evenness in my skin that I haven’t seen in a long time and my stubborn sun spots and acne scarring are fading beautifully. And although I love them- some of my freckles have faded too. I love the subtle scent the product has and the texture is divine. My skin soaks it up. I’m sure my skin would love another bottle- my bank account not so much. So if you’re in the market for a great vitamin C serum and you don’t mind spending more- don’t pass this up. Pretty packaging, great formula and an amazing brand. I’m intrigued  by this brand.",C.E.O. 15% Vitamin C Brightening Serum,Sunday Riley,Positive,
2762,5,2023-03-13,"Obsessed with this serum in my routine! I get quite a bit of redness on the cheeks after washing my face due to a little rosacea but this helps immediately calm and give my skin so much glow and hydration. I love putting this on before makeup for the glow from within look! I love the texture, bottle and smell, I will definitely be repurchasing when finished! Worth the price!",C.E.O. 15% Vitamin C Brightening Serum,Sunday Riley,Positive,
2763,1,2023-03-13,I’ve been using this product for a month or two now and honestly. Meh. I haven’t noticed anything ‘brightening’ about my face.

2767,5,2023-03-12,"I was really happy with the results of using this brightening serum from Sunday Riley after only 2 weeks of use. I found that It helped brighten hyperpigmentation and even out my texture substantially. The packaging is gorgeous and it smells really lovely. It really wakes you up. It faded some sun spots I’ve had for years within just 2 weeks. I think that’s due in large part to it being a really effective 15% vitamin c product, as I have used some creams and serums in the past that weren’t as potent and chock full of vitamin c so I didn’t see as quick and effective results. I have spent hundreds of dollars on lasers at my derm office and was shocked that this Sunday Riley vitamin c brightening serum did so much in such little time. It really saves you money because a little goes a long way! I’m really impressed with the velvety texture as it was not tacky or sticky but luxurious and really smoothing. It looked amazing under makeup however i preferred to use it at night.",C.E.O. 15% Vitamin C Brightening Serum,Sunday Riley,Positive,

Most days, my skin is completely fine and looks better than ever, but on a couple of different occasions, I’ve noticed some small bumps popping up immediately after applying the serum.

I have tried in addition to my regular steps but also just the face wash and serum it’s self. For my skin personally it leaves a nice glow when applied, and when it soaks into my skin it feels smooth and soft.

It’s a bit of a thicker serum, think more creamy as opposed to a more watery serum. It’s not sticky, like most Vitamin C serums tend to be. It does have a citrussy scent, so if you’re not a fan of fragrance, I would not recommend this product.

2778,4,2023-03-12,"I received this product for free from Influenster and Sunday Riley in exchange for my honest review. I love the packaging of the Sunday Riley CEO Vitamin C serum, I highly prefer having any serum with photosensitive actives (such as vitamin C) to be in a vacuum sealed pump. It has a medium thick cream/lotion consistency that does seem to sit on top of the skin a bit rather than absorbing instantly. It has a very faint scent of citrus, but not nearly as strong as the previous CEO product that I tried. Vitamin C is a staple in my evening skincare routine but I find it does take 1-3 months to start seeing results in decreasing hyperpigmentation or increasing skin brightness.",C.E.O. 15% Vitamin C Brightening Serum,Sunday Riley,Positive,

I find it sinks into the skin great, and leaves a glowy and plump look to my skin. I noticed a huge difference the first couple weeks of use in the brightness of my face  butttt I think the brightening affect has diminished (which is why I have substracted a star). I’ve added a photo of my hand immediately after use and I think it’s an instant brightening affect. A couple other things I’ve enjoyed about the product are the scent, light and refreshing and of course the packaging is great. I enjoy products with a pump, help it to stay fresh and keep unnecessary germs out. I think I would repurchase when I’ve used it up.",C.E.O. 15% Vitamin C Brightening Serum,Sunday Riley,Positive,

2784,3,2023-03-11,"I was super excited to try this out. I used it as directed, twice daily. It’s advertised as scent free. But it definitely has a great light orange scent, it feels really nice upon application. After a few days of daily usage. I noticed my skin was very dry, it was bumpy and the texture was rough and I did not like it at all. So I stopped using it for a few days and then tried it once a day. That seems to be working for me personally with no negative effects. All skin is different. Maybe it just wasn’t working with my skin. Or it was a shock to my skincare routine. But with not using it twice daily I’m seeing more improvement and would maybe purchase again.",C.E.O. 15% Vitamin C Brightening Serum,Sunday Riley,Positive,
2785,5,2023-03-11,I’ve been using it every morning since I got it and my skin looks radiant and amazing.  I noticed my skin brighter.  It’s very easy to apply and I don’t feel my skin sticky which is a very important point for me.,C.E.O. 15% Vitamin C Brightening Serum,Sunday Riley,Positive,
2786,5,2023-03-11,"Ur girl is slowly transforming her skin from spotty mess to bright, smooth, and bouncy. This CEO 15% Vitamin C Brightening Serum is one step in my gentle routine for acne-prone skin. It’s billed as a multifaceted way to quickly fight the look of dullness, dark spots, and discolorations. And it’s $85 full-price.NGL, I had this serum on my backburner until my esthetician said that higher Vitamin C concentrate equals less breakouts. This was the only bottle I had on hand that clearly enumerated the Vit C percentage, and it was very high. Cheers for brand transparency! Unlike many other serums containing Vitamin C, this one is shelf stable, which means I don’t have to worry too much about it going rancid. The creamlike texture is incredibly gentle and provides hydration. With this and my toner mist, I skip a moisturizer in the morning and head right to sunscreen after this serum. I love these precious extra minutes! It contains glycolic acid, which gently clears out pores without bothering my sensitive skin. In fact, it was another ingredient recommended by my esthetician to deal with stubborn blackheads. The TL;DR? If you are acne-prone and looking to treat dark spots and prevent sun-related aging, this is a great product. If you can get this without breaking the bank, I do suggest it.

This one gets four stars based on the smooth and light texture, compatibility with my other skincare and makeup products, and the durability/sturdiness of the packaging. It is scented, very mildly, and smells of orange oil. The only reason it’s not getting five stars is that I’ve been using it every day for the past with SPF and I’m still not quite sure I can see a difference in my dark spots, but I do think it’s probably working.

If you are looking for a good vitamin C serum for more sensitive skin as well, this is one I recommend, as someone with very sensitive skin to most vitamin C products.

However I always wanted to try this brand Sunday Riley for a while but I never got around to purchasing anything from it and for higher-end skincare I always want to try something out first before actually committing. I’m so glad I got to try out this product thank you so much influenster. I love the serum it’s actually a really lightweight and acts like a really nice moisturizer it doesn’t feel heavy or thick at all and it’s perfect for someone with oily skin. Now this is a vitamin C serum so it does have a very very faint orange scent. But it’s nothing to overpowering or anything like that. This moisturizes my skin pretty well for how dry and cold it is right now where I live. I will continue to use it in the next little while.

2804,3,2023-03-11,"I have been using Sunday Riley C.E.O serum for a couple weeks now, I haven’t noticed a huge improvement in my skin asides texture and a little bit of luminosity. I wouldn’t really call it a “Serum” but more so a lightweight cream. I believe the texture will be suitable for most skin types though. It does have a scent of orange oil … so if you’re looking for scent free this is not the product for you. This also is a high-grade strong Vitamin c so I would not recommend this product to people with sensitive skin. This product is fantastic to create a beautiful glow on your face after a stressful week and even out the texture, I also think it would work well on acne scars too. The serum seemed to even out the scar on my forehead quite a bit so I’m over the moon happy with that fact alone.  I believe you would need a couple of months of using this product to see solid results.",C.E.O. 15% Vitamin C Brightening Serum,Sunday Riley,Positive,

2806,4,2023-03-11,"This product works well, and the consistency is very hydrating. It also leaves a nice shimmer.

As someone who struggles with hyperpigmentation and uneven skin tone, I have tried countless brightening products over the years, but this one really stands out.One of the things I appreciate most about the Sunday Riley CEO Brightening Serum is its lightweight texture. It absorbs quickly and doesn’t leave any sticky or greasy residue on my skin. Plus, a little goes a long way, so the bottle lasts for quite a while.But what really sets this serum apart is its powerful blend of ingredients. The 15% Vitamin C, in particular, works wonders on my skin. I’ve noticed a significant improvement in the brightness and clarity of my complexion since incorporating this serum into my routine.Another great thing about the Sunday Riley CEO Brightening Serum is its versatility. It can be used morning or night, and it layers well with other products. I also appreciate that it doesn’t cause any irritation or breakouts, which can be a concern with some brightening products.Overall, I would highly recommend the Sunday Riley CEO Brightening Serum to anyone looking to improve their skin’s brightness and clarity.

2817,4,2023-03-10,"I received this in exchange for my honest review.  This serum is different than a lot of the serums I own. It has a base that when I smooth it on reminds me of sunscreen. It absorbs quickly into my skin but does leave almost a residue on my skin.  I’ve been using this alone, nightly for the past 4 weeks. 1 pump is more than enough for my whole face.  I believe my skin does look a little brighter, less red and a little more even in tone. FINAL THOUGHTS: Not sure if I love this serum enough to purchase it again, especially since it is an expensive product I want to absolutely love something if I’m going to spend that much money. EXTRAS: Love the packaging. The pump has a lock top and the box was beautiful. The box also says “1-2 pumps morning or night” and the bottle says “1-2 pumps morning and night”. I didn’t realize the bottle said differently and had only read the box and used it once per day. PHOTOS: My photos show day one (Feb 9), and my face after using it nightly (March 7).

In general, everage good quality serum is expensive therefore I would assume it is still reasonable in average.I have been using this bottle for over few weeks and I noticed improvement on my skin. This product gave me growing  look.It is lightweight and has citrus fragrance which I reallt like (however it is a slightly strong at the beggining).

And though subtle, it has definitely had a brightening effect on my skin. These pictures were taken in the same room with the same natural lighting at the same time of day, no filters, no makeup.

The serum itself is very creamy and hydrating, it felt amazing on my skin. After a few days I started breaking out tho, and my skin did not feel good. Now it is starting to clear up and my skin feels a lot smoother and hydrated and there are less dark spots. I believe after continuous use, my skin should be brighter and more hydrated. I actually really did like this serum, I felt like it was very effective for me, so anyone with dry skin with dark spots, this should work amazingly for you. #complimentary #GlowLikeaCEO #CEOSerumVoxBox #sundayriley #ceoserum @Influenster @SundayRiley",C.E.O. 15% Vitamin C Brightening Serum,Sunday Riley,Positive,

I have very sensitive skin and i only use it during night time, maybe also the reason why I haven’t seen any difference yet. And the fact that i have only been using it for two weeks is probably not long enough to see a lot of difference. I will continue using it, a lot of skin products needs more that two weeks to see any improvement.

There’s a super slight shimmer to the serum too which gives you that instant satisfaction dewy skin look without looking sparkly or just oily. The 15% tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate is a high concentration and quite an advanced form of vitamin c - this serum is worth the price tag if you’re looking for a quality vitamin c - it really feels and acts a cut above the rest.

A problem in which I have experienced more than once, with similar products in the past.The results can be seen in the photos accompanying this review and we’re taken 10 days apart.Although I saw results, I am unsure how long one bottle will last and that will be the determining factor on if I repurchase the product, due to the higher price point.",C.E.O. 15% Vitamin C Brightening Serum,Sunday Riley,Positive,

2841,5,2023-03-07,".I received this product for free from @Influenster and @SundayRiley in exchange for my honest review.  Sunday Riley is a brand I have been so curious about, mainly to determine if their higher product price points translate to product effectiveness. I tested the C.E.O 15% Vitamin C Brightening Serum for about 3 weeks.  The formula uses the THD Ascorbate form of Vitamin C which is an extremely stable form of VitaminC. It also has Glycolic Acid, which is one of my favourite skincare ingredients. There are two additional star ingredients that I’m not as familiar with: Phytosterols Complex (helps reduce the look of redness due to skin sensitivity) and Saccharide Isomerate Extract (helps reduce the appearance of pores while reinforcing the skin’s moisture barrier).The packaging is simple and functional. The pump is effective and does not get clogged or leave excess product that dries up at the tip.  The pump also has a locking mechanism, making this a good product to travel with!The consistency of this orange citrus scented serum is like a lightweight moisturizer which surprisingly provides a lot of hydration that I feel normal to oily skin types may not even need a moisturizer. Overall, this is a two thumbs up for me. It gives me an instant glow and brightened my skin tone with consistent use. I found that this product also reduced the appearance of my nose pores and my skin also appeared to look smoother.  However, as with all VitaminC products, it doesn’t fade the appearance of my dark spots.",C.E.O. 15% Vitamin C Brightening Serum,Sunday Riley,Positive,

It feels great and hydrating on the skin. My one note is that even though it is called a serum it definitely feels more like a lotion. If you are looking for a true serum - lighter consistency, more water or gel like - then this may be a bit too rich for you. Though it is more of a lotion it sinks in quickly and doesn’t leave a film of heavy feelingI recieved this product to review from Influenster though all opinions are my own (I had tried a sample of this years ago and loved it )",C.E.O. 15% Vitamin C Brightening Serum,Sunday Riley,Positive,

2863,5,2023-03-06,"I received this product for free from Influencer to review it. To be totally transparent this is my first time using a specific vitamin C treatment on my skin. First of all wow, the packaging definitely reflects the price point. It’s really nice and feels luxurious. The formula is light and feels amazing. Sat beautifully under my moisturizer and definitely plumped up my skin, the added hydration is noticeable. The light orange scent is perfect. Not overpowering, I love it. As far as results go I am noticing a definite improvement in overall hydration. My skin looks a bit more smooth though I’m not noticing much brightening but my skin is pretty rough in my own opinion and I find it hard to tell if there’s improvements in some specific things. Colour and tone is one of those things. All in all I think it’s a lovely product. It’s expensive but you really don’t need much. It goes a long way, 1-2 pumps max.

2898,4,2023-03-02,"I received Sunday Riley’s CEO vitamin C brightening serum for free from Sunday Riley and influenster to give my honest review. I started using the serum at night. Here is how I started. So after washing my face, I let it air dry. Then I started with one pump of serum and increased it to 1.5 pumps. Then I’d use my nighttime hydrating cream and top it up with some face oil. I have very dry skin so I do use multiple hydrating products to keep it soft and supple. After a few days of using the serum regularly, I notice some dry patches on my face but they were gone by the first week. I am still using it every night until about a month to see if it brings any glow because right now I don’t see much difference in my skin glow wise but I notice a slight sensitivity to sunlight. My skin already has photosensitivity issues so when using this product I need to be extra careful. Overall, I like the smell and texture of the product. I have used other vitamins C serums before they usually have a weird smell and colour. So glad this product doesn’t leave my face looking orange.

This serum contains 15% Vitamin C and is used for brightening dull/uneven textured skin, anti-aging such as: fine lines/wrinkles and dark spots, as well as to help minimize your pores. I loved the light orange scent and creamy texture of this product and the cooling affect I got when applying from a glass bottle. My skin absorbed this immediately! After using for a couple weeks my skin looked brighter and was left with a hydrated, glowy/dewy finish to my skin after every use. Unfortunately my skin is very sensitive and I did break out in a couple areas with cystic type acne, which I don’t normally experience. I feel this is due to the high percentage of vitamin c; no fault to the product.Overall this is a nice, hydrating and brightening serum, which although costly, did do what it claims, and comes in a nice sized glass bottle with a pump to control the amount of product dispensed.

3023,5,2023-03-13,"I needed to write a review on this product because i feel a lot of the bad reviews are people who aren’t using/applying it well. This product has been a game changer for me so once you master this product, you’ll keep buying it. Growing up I never really got much sleep or drank enough water so my biggest concern was the bags under my eyes and two wrinkles forming. I’ve tried so many eye products, and I really thought none would be able to completely get rid of my bags, until I tried this one! It is so hydrating, my skin loves it and my under eye looks plump and so healthy and it stays like that all day. If I don’t use this Kiehl’s product, I noticed my bags immediately. It’s crazy how much of a difference this product makes! I’m in my early 30s and my older sister raved about it, which is what made me buy it, and I’m now on my second tub. Tips for using this product: First off, buy the smaller .05 fl oz size. It’s thick and a little bit goes a longgg way. My first purchase was the larger size,  only used it in the morning and it lasted around 1.5- 2 yrs. However, it did start to separate after awhile so I’d used a little spatula from a previous product to mix it when this happened and the product was just as effective.  Since it’s thick, it doesn’t apply as easy as lighter eye creams. You can’t just smear it under your eye or it will tug at the skin and not spread as far. For application I either put three little dots under my eye and tap it in that way or warm it up between my fingers and then tap it under my eye to apply it. Yes, it takes a little getting used to, but the results are unmatched. Previously, I’ve used both YTP eye creams, ole Heinekens, glow recipe retinol, Estée Lauder advanced repair, and none beat this Kiehl’s product. I’m not even a huge fan of Kiehls, this is their only product that I’ve purchased and will continue to purchase. Ofncourse it’d be nice if it was easier to apply and not separate but the results are amazing so 10/10 recommend.",Creamy Eye Treatment with Avocado,Kiehl's Since 1851,Positive,
3024,1,2023-03-11,I’ve tried this product before and loved it but when I ordered it recently it’s like I got an expired batch…it’s completely liquid and has separated. Will be returning for my money back.,Creamy Eye Treatment with Avocado,Kiehl's Since 1851,Positive,
3025,2,2023-03-10,"Goes on really heavy and is difficult to spread evenly. I end up with an unpleasant sticky texture and heaviness over my eyes. I used it for a week before bedtime and I woke up with more puffiness around my eyes than usual. Doesn’t really give off enough hydration, but two stars since it’s a “better than nothing” effect.

3042,5,2023-03-15,"Very impressed with TO’s Rosehip Oil. I’ve used many in the past but none with this texture. When I apply this (3 drops on a night time) it sinks in within seconds as though it was never there! It doesn’t even ’feel’ like an oil when applying, almost like a water-in-oil. Hard to describe and something you can only appreciate once you’ve tried it for yourself. Having said that, I believe it depends on the batch you get as there are natural variations in aroma, color and texture with each one. Mine was 1B02 which is printed in blue ink near the bottom of the bottle, on the glass itself. Also unlike other Rosehip oils I’ve used in the past, this one doesn’t smell of anything unless I really put my nose up close and even then it’s very faint.  As for the benefits, I love the hydration I get from this and how it gradually fades acne marks. Love the simple fuss-free packaging and easy to use dropper that allows for a measured, precise dispensing of the oil. The only thing I don’t like, having a few TO products in rotation is that they all look identical at a glance and I’ve often started to apply one before realizing it isn’t what I thought it was. The writing on the label is also quite small which doesn’t help. But these are minor points, the bottom line is it works and is UNIQUE compared to the many Rosehip oils I’ve used over the years.

3068,3,2023-03-08,"My mom has always told me that the best time to start preventing and treating wrinkles is when you’re still young. I have the beginnings of laugh lines so I was very excited when I got the offer to try out Lancome’s face serum for free. I’ve always heard great things about Genifique. My first impression of the Genifique is that it goes on nice and smoothly. It doesn’t make your skin feel oily but instead gives it a nice hydrated feel. It’s a lightweight serum that would be especially perfect in the hot, humid Louisiana heat. Over the course of the week and a half that I used the Genifique I felt like for at least the time immediately after applying the serum it felt like my slight laugh lines were barely noticeable. I can’t say that I saw a huge difference but I really don’t have any wrinkles so it’s hard to speak to how well it diminishes the appearance of fine line and wrinkles. My mother is of a more mature age and says that she sees a noticeable difference in the appearance of her fine lines and wrinkles. I’d be willing to try the product out longer to see if I notice more of a difference. For someone my age and for the price I don’t think I would necessarily recommend this product unless the person has a big problem with fine lines and wrinkles. I’ve used other serums that work just as well to leave my skin feeling moisturized and have a much lower price point.",Advanced Génifique Radiance Boosting Face Serum,Lancôme,Positive,
3069,3,2023-03-07,"First, I’ll say that I don’t dislike this serum. I have supremely dry skin and typically use much thicker serums, but even with this product’s sort of light consistency I find it very moisturizing after cleansing. Not moisturizing enough to use alone for me, but I can tell it’s more than just glycerin in a bottle. It plays well under many of my go-to moisturizers (Farmacy’s Honey Halo, presently) and I’ve never had a problem with it under makeup. I am currently experiencing skin texture/mild acne and I’m not blaming this product, but it didn’t do much to smooth texture flare-ups on my skin. Though, it is very good at keeping things moisturized, and the parts of my face that aren’t prone to redness/irritation/acne are doing FABULOSULY.I bought this on sale and have been using it for about 3 months. At first, I was using it both day and night, then I realized it had Vitamin C and it actually makes no sense to use at night, despite the instructions on the bottle. I didn’t notice a difference when I went down to once a day, and I am a bit peeved that Lancome suggests twice daily usage on such an expensive serum.  I don’t regret the purchase (especially at 50% off), but I don’t think I will buy it full-price when I run out at this point in my life. If my texture were due solely to signs of aging (fine-lines, sun damage) etc. I think I would definitely consider it as a highly moisturizing, non-irritating DAYTIME serum. I could totally see myself using this consistently in about 10-15 years, so I hope they don’t change the formulation AND I get a promotion :)",Advanced Génifique Radiance Boosting Face Serum,Lancôme,Positive,

After using it 2 times daily for a few months, I have noticed some differences but just not major ones. It helped mostly with under eye puffiness but not so much with dark circles.

3641,2,2023-03-08,"I got a farmacy kit during the last vib sale and I was excited to use it after seeing many great reviews for this moisturizer. I have very dry, dehydrated skin. The kind of dryness where if I wash my face I immediately need to follow with my skincare routine otherwise my skin gets super dry and tight. At first I thought it was a good moisturizer and it smelled nice. It is thick and moisturizing but not to the point where my dryness necessarily went away. I had been using it for weeks, just hitting the halfway point in the pot and then came the acne. At first I thought it was just hormones but it was constant and nothing made it better. Finally I put two and two together and stopped using this moisturizer my acne gradually started to calm down. It gave me both types of acne, horrible cystic acne deep in my skin which was painful and tiny little bumps/clogged pores(not whiteheads). All of the acne was along my jaw area and sometimes on my upper neck under my jaw where I would take the product down. Unfortunately for me I also have the type of skin that immediately scars when I get bigger acne bumps and now I’m left with a bunch of dark spots along my jawline that I now have to find a good vitamin c to get rid of. If you have acne prone skin please get a sample or a smaller size to try out first if you even want to risk it. I wish I had taken the acne reviews seriously but I thought it couldn’t happen to me. I almost never write reviews either but I feel I should for those considering this who are acne prone. I just wish it would have worked out because it is a nice product. :/",Honey Halo Ultra-Hydrating Ceramide Moisturizer,Farmacy,Positive,

3644,5,2023-03-07,"I have incredibly dry skin and probably try 3-5 facial moisturizers every year. The kind of dry skin where you need a dedicated moisturizer that you use both night and day, because you’ve never found a SPF-infused moisturizer that works well enough so you just resign yourself to buying a really big tub of moisturizer and another SPF whose formulation you pray doesn’t pill with it.  Sometimes I find moisturizers that I really like or found non-offensive, but by the end of the tub it  was hard to justify the price based on the so-so performance (looking at you Tatcha Dewy skin) OR I started out loving it but then my skin has decided it wasn’t all that great and I’m better off just putting Curel on my face until I find something new. I bought the smallest tub of this in November ’22 thanks to a fellow-shopper who raved about it to try it out. All moisturizers feel amazing in the store with that little back of the hand test we all do, but this felt...different? My skin felt like it had ’slip’...like I put conditioner in it and could detangle it lol.  A lot of people complain about ’tackiness’ in moisturizers, but for those of us whose skin gets tight and flaky if we don’t put anything on .02 seconds after cleansing, you know that tackiness is a moisture barrier that will transform from “tacky“ to moisturized if you just wait 10 seconds. This product does that. My skin feels crazy hydrated all day. I wake up with soft well-moisturized skin in the morning. And my skin hasn’t rejected it now that I’m on my second bottle (I went back for the 1.7 size). I’m almost down to the end of this tub and I’m looking forward to buying the 3.4oz size next time. I can confidently say that’s never happened to me with any other face lotion. For the first time I don’t feel like browsing more expensive options in the hopes they’ll provide something I’m missing, because Honey Halo hits all the marks!

The scent and feel of the product is pleasant. The microbeads are a luminous gold that leave a lovely sheen. However, they settle to the bottom of the bottle quite quickly so you have to shake the bottle just before use. I used it morning and evening for roughly four days, following the application technique used by the Guerlain Spa facialists. The product absorbed very quickly. I have sensitive combination skin and the product left my skin feeling more dry than I’d like and I don’t feel it added any benefit.

Usually my go to lip product is balm dot com from glossier, but this product goes above and beyond that one! My new must have item :$",Lip Butter Balm,Summer Fridays,Positive,
3870,5,2023-03-20,"I love the clear version, I buy like 5 at a time so I’m never without, it’s not the longest lasting but it does the job for at least 2 hours at a time. The pink version is a mid tone pink, not milky sheer but not fuscia bright. Paired with a deep lip liner and/or lip tint your lips will look irresistible . I was asked if I got lip filler done and all I had changed in my lip combo was the gloss - same liner. I hope they come out with a sheer milky pink gloss in the future!",Lip Butter Balm,Summer Fridays,Positive,
3871,5,2023-03-20,"My first SF product because i’ve been hearing many good things about this brand! Needless to say, i’m impressed. I got the new pink sugar balm & it smells SO good oh my.. definitely will be my favorite go-to lip balm right now!",Lip Butter Balm,Summer Fridays,Positive,
3872,4,2023-03-20,"The smells is amazing and isn’t crazy stick. But not the most hydrating lip product wore off after a bit and left my lips dry, but it’s thick and smells so good",Lip Butter Balm,Summer Fridays,Positive,
3873,5,2023-03-19,"Absolutely love this balm, not at all sticky but very hydrating and soft! Bought the cherry and it gives a nice rosy pink color to your lips and it smells really good too, scent isn’t too overwhelming so its good too if you’re sensitive",Lip Butter Balm,Summer Fridays,Positive,
3874,3,2023-03-19,"The scent is a bit cloying and sweet, but the main reason for my low rating is that every time I use this the top layer of my lips dries up and peels off. Seemed more like a gloss than a balm.",Lip Butter Balm,Summer Fridays,Positive,
3875,3,2023-03-19,"I love the texture of SF vanilla beige and thought this slightly darker tint would be fun. It was slightly thicker than the other, but also significantly darker. Did not deliver the sheer subtle tint i was looking for. Returned it",Lip Butter Balm,Summer Fridays,Positive,
3876,5,2023-03-19,"I really like this product. I bought color poppy it has a slight tint of coral pink. It smells citrusy. The texture is soft, non sticky and moisturizing well. Even at -30 my lips felt moisturized.",Lip Butter Balm,Summer Fridays,Positive,
3877,4,2023-03-19,"Love the product! So soft and nice. Wish their was less air in the packaging and more product because you need to press really hard to get any product out, you don’t really taste the flavor but it’s a nice color",Lip Butter Balm,Summer Fridays,Positive,
3878,5,2023-03-19,"Very Moisturizing and leaves lips w a beautiful red tint! replaces my fav cherry lip balm from glossier, and smells like cherry icee !",Lip Butter Balm,Summer Fridays,Positive,
3879,3,2023-03-19,"I wouldn’t repurchase. It feels like a lip oil and seeps into your mouth, personally I don’t want to taste a lip product. I don’t like the rubber/silicone applicator either, I can’t get a good glide unless I squeeze out more than I actually need. I also don’t find it to be hydrating either... The color is pretty lol",Lip Butter Balm,Summer Fridays,Positive,
3880,4,2023-03-19,"This stuff smells amazing!!!!! It has a very sweet smell, comparable to buttercream frosting. The packaging is super cute and the applicator is high quality and does not make a mess. The only reason I give this product a 4/5 stars is because I wish the formula was a bit thicker.",Lip Butter Balm,Summer Fridays,Positive,
3881,4,2023-03-19,"I love this product so much, it makes my lips feel super hydrated and the smell is amazing. The only negative is that it’s half empty basically. So I guess I’ll just ration my use of it.",Lip Butter Balm,Summer Fridays,Positive,
3882,3,2023-03-19,"Pink sugar is basically clear. If you are looking for a pink color, I would search elsewhere. It has a buttercream scent but that fades quickly. Kind of bummed it should have had more of a pink color.",Lip Butter Balm,Summer Fridays,Positive,
3883,5,2023-03-18,"I ran out of the original and got this one. The color payoff is extremely sheer but it added just enough warmth to my lips. The smell is slightly different from the clear version, this one smells like a traditional vanilla cupcake candle from like yankee candle, if that makes sense.",Lip Butter Balm,Summer Fridays,Positive,
3884,5,2023-03-18,guys it smells just like the marshmallows from lucky charms. doesn’t give too much color which I don’t care for because it is moisturizing.,Lip Butter Balm,Summer Fridays,Positive,
3885,5,2023-03-18,"Such a pretty tint! I was torn between this one and the pink sugar, I’m glad I got cherry! Tint lasted a long time and the smell is amazing. Don’t hesitate just get it!",Lip Butter Balm,Summer Fridays,Positive,
3886,5,2023-03-18,I got both Pink Sugar and Cherry and I love them!! Pink sugar really has a super faint pink tint but it smells delicious and looks so cute. The Cherry one is really pigmented and the scent is light,Lip Butter Balm,Summer Fridays,Positive,
3887,5,2023-03-18,Divine. Smooth and not at all sticky. The hint of color is very flattering. I’m in love.,Lip Butter Balm,Summer Fridays,Positive,

3890,4,2023-03-18,"Love this lip balm for the summer, and how it’s very moisturizing and smells divine! However, I wish it was more pigmented!!",Lip Butter Balm,Summer Fridays,Positive,
3891,5,2023-03-18,"Divine! Scrumptious! All of them! But wow thank you sooo much Summer Fridays for creating a warm baked scent. These balms are my holy grail. They are a splurge but I love a good lippie. This it is. Smooth, not sticky, smells divine. ONLY ISSUE: like others, I agree 100% there is NOT enough product in the tube at all. That’s the only downfall. But that’s a choice you can make as a buyer. The vanillas, brown sugar, pink sugar are a staple and just delicious! Summer Fridays is you’re listening- need more product in the tube for the price. Otherwise, bravo! Amazing product.",Lip Butter Balm,Summer Fridays,Positive,
3892,2,2023-03-18,"I wanted to love Pink Sugar. However, I’m extremely disappointed with the color pay off. It smells amazing and feels great on my lips, I just wanted more color.",Lip Butter Balm,Summer Fridays,Positive,
3893,4,2023-03-18,"so I picked up pink sugar and I like it, the formula is the same and the scent is more of a vanilla cupcake, and the pink tone is very subtle which is why I gave it 4 and not 5 stars, I just want a tad more color.",Lip Butter Balm,Summer Fridays,Positive,
3894,5,2023-03-18,I got both pink sugar and cherry and let me just say they’re the best! Pink sugar smells exactly like the birthday cake balm dotcom and the cherry smells like a less artificial version of the cherry balm dotcom. These balms are super hydrating and leave the lips looking and feeling great for hours. I barely have to reapply that’s how good they are!,Lip Butter Balm,Summer Fridays,Positive,
3895,3,2023-03-17,"I’m so upset! I bought Pink Sugar right when it launched at midnight, since i loooove the Brown Sugar. This one has zero pigment!!!! I was expecting it to show a pink hue on my lips & it just looks like chapstick! I expected way more :/",Lip Butter Balm,Summer Fridays,Positive,
3896,4,2023-03-17,Just got it today! It has a balm that lasts for sure. I’ve had it on for 6 hours now. I will say I’m not very happy that it feels 1/4 empty. It took a bit to squeeze and get some balm out. For this price I would expect ￼it to be full-ish is all.,Lip Butter Balm,Summer Fridays,Positive,
3897,5,2023-03-17,I got this product and it is so amazing! The color is very subtle but it smells and looks amazing. Definitely recommend buying!,Lip Butter Balm,Summer Fridays,Positive,
3898,4,2023-03-17,"love the lip butter balms I have all of them but disappointed in cherry, it’s beautiful but mine came seemly more than half empty when with pink sugar or the others I did not need to squeeze as much for product which makes me really sad..",Lip Butter Balm,Summer Fridays,Positive,

3901,4,2023-03-17,"This one is pretty and smells so good! It smells like a Cherry popsicle. The same as pink sugar, you gotta squeeze a little more for something to come out.",Lip Butter Balm,Summer Fridays,Positive,
3902,4,2023-03-17,"Pink sugar is a very sheer pink and smells like a warm baked sugar cookie. I don’t mind that the pink is very subtle, it’s the fact that I have to squeeze a little more compared to the other colors I have.",Lip Butter Balm,Summer Fridays,Positive,
3903,5,2023-03-17,"Can’t say enough great things about these!!! I have Vanilla Beige, Poppy, Cherry and Pink Sugar. All perfectly tinted, glossy and hydrating. Accutane made my lips incredibly dry, and this doesn’t irritate my lips. Obsessed!",Lip Butter Balm,Summer Fridays,Positive,

3907,2,2023-03-17,"Product is great, too bad the tube is literally half empty with air  compared to the older versions. Bought a brand new old version shade to compare and the new ones definitely weigh less with less product.",Lip Butter Balm,Summer Fridays,Positive,
3908,4,2023-03-17,love the product! it smells so good and is super hydrating. unfortunately i feel like the packaging is a little bad? it’s really cute but i had to squeeze a little too hard to get any product out. maybe that’s just me though,Lip Butter Balm,Summer Fridays,Positive,
3909,5,2023-03-17,"Hydration 10/10, moisture 10/10, feeling on the lips 10/10, color 10/10. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this product I will forever repurchase.

3910,5,2023-03-17,Wow!!!! The smell is AMAZING and not over powering. The shade is perfect! It’s not too pigmented but it has the right amount of pigment for everyday use! Deff restocking it,Lip Butter Balm,Summer Fridays,Positive,
3911,5,2023-03-17,"OBSESSED!! This is the best lip balm I have ever used, and I have used a lot! First of all, the smell is AMAZING! It gives me nostalgic vibes of something from when I was a kid, maybe easy bake oven? Sooo yummy! It looks so pretty and glossy on, perfect subtle tint. I bought pink, vanilla and vanilla beige and I am so excited to try the rest! Please never stop selling these exactly the way they are!",Lip Butter Balm,Summer Fridays,Positive,
3912,4,2023-03-17,"I LOVE these lip balms. I have them in every color. I love the new pink sugar but was disappointed that upon applying the first time, the tube deflated to half the size. I did not have this issue with any of the other colors! Did anyone else notice this?",Lip Butter Balm,Summer Fridays,Positive,

3915,5,2023-03-17,"I am in. love.!! Smells like frosted animal cookies, perf formula, hydrating, nonsticky. Please restock the pink I already want to restock!!",Lip Butter Balm,Summer Fridays,Positive,
3916,4,2023-03-17,"I love the formula of this lip balm, it’s so hydrating and it smells amazing. Unfortunately the tube seems full of air and once you use it for the first time, the tube deflates and looks half empty. This shouldn’t happen with a lip balm this expensive .",Lip Butter Balm,Summer Fridays,Positive,
3917,5,2023-03-17,I love this lip balm; The vanilla flavor & the applicator I’m obsessed with!! Super hydrating and stays on longer than majority of others I’ve tried. I highly recommend trying it out if you haven’t!! Def worth it.,Lip Butter Balm,Summer Fridays,Positive,
3918,5,2023-03-16,"I wear this over lip color for a gloss effect, and alone at night as a hydrating balm. One tube with daily use lasted me about four months, and I’ve just reordered. The price point is high for a lip balm, but the quality and quantity are worth the spend in my opinion.",Lip Butter Balm,Summer Fridays,Positive,
3919,5,2023-03-16,I just got this product and it feels absolutely amazing on my lips: This scent and color is stunning on any skin complexion. Highly recommend it’s so worth it!,Lip Butter Balm,Summer Fridays,Positive,
3920,5,2023-03-16,I prefer this one and I have pink sugar and brown sugar as well. The pink sugar smells good but it smells like all the other “vanilla” lip balms I have. The cherry is to die for and give a beautiful tint. The applicators are soft silicone and not hard plastic like the other versions,Lip Butter Balm,Summer Fridays,Positive,
3921,5,2023-03-16,"I love, love love, loveeee this lip balm. It’s hydrating and I just love the way it feels on my lips. After trying pink sugar and cherry, I can say without a doubt that out of all of the flavors/colors, my favorite is pink sugar. Smells just like buttercream icing!  Compared to the other colors, pink sugar is definitely a whisper of pink, while cherry is the most pigmented color and smells just like sweet cherries.  I hope they continue to expand their selection of colors and flavors s.",Lip Butter Balm,Summer Fridays,Positive,
3922,5,2023-03-16,This product is actually unreal! Will purchase for life and that’s not an exaggeration. I’m putting one in each of my bridesmaid proposal boxes as well! Truly deserves all the hype they get and more <3,Lip Butter Balm,Summer Fridays,Positive,
3923,5,2023-03-16,"I’ve been hearing such good thinks about this lip butter and i just had to buy it, the pink sugar smells like frosting or like an iced animal cookie, 10/10 my new favorite lip balm",Lip Butter Balm,Summer Fridays,Positive,
3924,5,2023-03-16,"If you are a fan of sweet smelling products- do not hesitate. Each flavor I recommend. The pink smells exactly like birthday cake and is now my favorite gloss. Brown sugar is also perfect, especially with the tint.",Lip Butter Balm,Summer Fridays,Positive,
3925,5,2023-03-16,I have been holding off on buying summer Fridays balm just because I am a laneige girl through and through but once they came out with pink sugar I couldn’t resist. Very hydrating and smells delicious! Def added to favourites!,Lip Butter Balm,Summer Fridays,Positive,
3926,5,2023-03-16,"It smells exactly like cherry starbursts to me but it’s not overpowering. You can sheer it out the red but it still is very pigmented especially if you are on the lighter side, it will show up a lot more even if you sheer it out than on somebody who has a deeper skin tone. So keep that in mind. Hydrating as always, love the new ones!",Lip Butter Balm,Summer Fridays,Positive,
3927,5,2023-03-16,"A thing to note, it is not a noticeable pink especially if you have more pigmented lips if your lips are on the lighter side it can show up a tad more but not too much. It smells exactly like birthday cake to me! Think like glossier (og formula) bday or rhode bday balm. Not too overpowering in scent though. Just like all the other balms, it’s very hydrating.",Lip Butter Balm,Summer Fridays,Positive,
3928,2,2023-03-16,"I have gotten the vanilla one before and loved it so I purchased the pink one. It is still very hydrating and I love the scent but the the color is way to sheer and does not show up at all. In addition, when I opened it it was so full but after squeezing it it deflated. Half of the lip balm was empty and pumped full of air.",Lip Butter Balm,Summer Fridays,Positive,
3929,5,2023-03-16,"Love it! Purchased cherry and vanilla, they’re super hydrating and feel great. The scents aren’t overwhelming and the pigment on cherry is gorgeous. I think its a little more sheer than the swatches pictured but its still very pretty. 10/10 recommend!",Lip Butter Balm,Summer Fridays,Positive,
3930,5,2023-03-15,"When it comes to lip balms/glosses, I would have NEVERR spend $24 on a single one, but these are 100% worth it! They are moisturizing to the lips, light-weight, non-sticky, and the scents are to die for!",Lip Butter Balm,Summer Fridays,Positive,
3931,2,2023-03-15,"Great formula, very moisturizing and stays in place, but I purchased this lip balm mainly for the scent, I had tested it at a sephora store and adored the strong vanilla scent, but the one I received from my online order has no scent at all unfortunately... I am not sure if I have recieved a defective lip balm or they changed the formula or what but I am very dissapointed.",Lip Butter Balm,Summer Fridays,Positive,

3937,2,2023-03-14,"I really wanted to love this. It’s good, but not $31.00 good! I actually prefer Burt’s Bee’s Lip Shine, which is a fraction of the cost. It’s pretty much the same! Save your money folks!",Lip Butter Balm,Summer Fridays,Positive,
3938,5,2023-03-14,It smells so good and hydrates my lips. I love the application tip it’s bigger so i don’t have to reapply so many times for full coverage on my lips.,Lip Butter Balm,Summer Fridays,Positive,

3946,5,2023-03-13,A must have! I keep it in my bag whenever I go out. It has a nice vanilla scent and I has a nice gloss appearance. The lip balm isn’t sticky and very hydrating!,Lip Butter Balm,Summer Fridays,Positive,
3947,5,2023-03-13,"I bought this because i’m on acne medication that makes my lips super dry, so I was looking for lip balm-like products that have color to them to kind of replace a traditional lipstick/lipgloss. I really love the packaging and the applicator, it has a curve on the tip that hugs your lips. I love the color Vanilla Beige, it’s a perfect nude for my my light/med skin tone and has a good amount of color to it but still has that translucency I was looking for so the color doesn’t accentuate dryness. It is moisturizing but I wouldn’t say it’s more moisturizing than a traditional lip balm and i still use it in combination with other lip balms. I do really like this and I would love to try more shades.",Lip Butter Balm,Summer Fridays,Positive,
3948,5,2023-03-12,One of the best lip balms I have tried! Gives you a nice glossy look without being too sticky. Vanilla is a nice sheer gloss and Vanilla Beige has a beautiful neutral tint. Always have one of these in my bag!,Lip Butter Balm,Summer Fridays,Positive,

3953,1,2023-03-11,For how much this lip balm costs it’s upsetting how much you have to squeeze to get the first use. Nearly squeezed till it’s flat and I just bought it brand new. I wish they’d put more product in the tubes,Lip Butter Balm,Summer Fridays,Positive,

3960,3,2023-03-07,"Based off of all the reviews and the buzz around the product I had high expectations and was somewhat disappointed. It’s honestly nothing special, especially for the price.Really comfortable applicator, smell is amazing, don’t really get any colour tint but thats ok, shiny but not too shiny, nice for every day when you want to look put together but don’t want to look too done up.I think it actually dried my lips out and maybe irritated them. I use it more like a gloss with my trusty drugstore lip balm underneath. Was originally going to return but decided to keep it because the smell is just that good.",Lip Butter Balm,Summer Fridays,Positive,
3961,4,2023-03-07,I’ve had mine for 6 months. I use it pretty often when my lips are dry. One might say; 31$ is outrageous. If you like compliments the packaging will give you that. If you like aesthetics and take photos that’s your “it“ product. Comes down to 5$/month. I will repurchase. Sticky and the tint is nice for combination makeup and lip liner. But it won’t last all day you have to reapply.,Lip Butter Balm,Summer Fridays,Negative,3.0

3964,3,2023-03-07,"I wanted to love these lip balms so bad after hearing everyone rave about them. I have vanilla beige and brown sugar and they both smell delicious and add gorgeous tints to the lips. Unfortunately, these balms only look decent if you have no texture on your lips.

3969,5,2023-03-06,"I was hesitant to buy this gloss since it is $24 and had a couple of bad reviews, but I LOVE it! It goes on easy, easy to smooth on the lips and has the perfect color for just an everyday lip.

3984,1,2023-03-04,"A balm that dries lips, continued to give it a chance because I really wanted to love it. The bottle reminded me of a paint tube applicator to big very inconvenient to Cary and the applicator was abnormally big and the smell wasn’t there either. After a week I gave up it wasn’t worth it my lips kept being Chapa as soon as I would switch to a different on it went away",Lip Butter Balm,Summer Fridays,Positive,
3985,1,2023-03-04,Smells bad and overhyped. Color is super sheer and looks clear on lips. Not very moisturising. Also ingredients weren’t as described online. Not impressed at all.,Lip Butter Balm,Summer Fridays,Negative,2.0

4000,2,2023-03-20,"This is probably my 15th container of this stuff, I have been so loyal to it for YEARS. However, they changed the formula and I tried to be optimistic. No. It’s sort of terrible. It’s heavy, waxy, and much less hydrating. The old formula had this unique thin, glossy but not greasy or waxy texture that was really amazing. The new formula is just your average lip balm. Nothing special. Waxy, hard, not particularly flattering in appearance.  I guess the plus side is I’m freed from the expensive clutches of addictive expensive lip balm and can just use Bert’s Bees.",Sugar Lip Balm Hydrating Treatment,fresh,Negative,3.0

4005,2,2023-03-12,This stuff is so overpriced... it’s just a basic tinted lip balm that in itself is not even that moisturizing. It does smell nice but so does Burts Bees for a 1/3 of the price.,Sugar Lip Balm Hydrating Treatment,fresh,Positive,

4013,1,2023-03-05,"I read the reviews but still had to see for myself. I brought my old tube to the store and compared visually. The new one appeared much drier, but I still thought I need to give it a try. What a waste of time and money! It’s a completely different product! It dries my lips out and it no longer adds pretty, soft color to my lips. It went from being the best lip balm I’d ever used to the absolute worst. It’s going back. I wouldn’t use it if it was free, much less pay over $25 for it! So disappointing. Why do companies do this?!? Now I’m going to have to search for a replacement and will probably end up using my cheapo tinted Burt’s Bees. Nowhere near as pretty as the original Sugar, but at least it moisturizes my lips!",Sugar Lip Balm Hydrating Treatment,fresh,Positive,

I know a lot of “experts“ say an eye cream isn’t necessary but I do like using them and this one is really nice - hydrating, non-irritating, seems to “play well“ with my concealer in the daytime.
